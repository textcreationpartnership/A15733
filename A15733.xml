            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The difference betweene my Propoſition, and his, ſtands onely in one word; He diſables the Miniſter in particular:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20998:13"/> I <hi>euery man</hi> generally, and perticularly; but I keepe his ſenſe whole, and intire. For the reaſon, that he giueth in the proofe of his Maior, doth ſhew, that therefore miniſters are not to be credited, becauſe being men they may erre. And indeed whatſoeuer imperfection is in any Miniſter, he hath it, not as he is a miniſter, but as he is a man; and therefore if his propoſition be true mine is,</p>
               <p>The aſſumption needs no other proofe but that, firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councils, and Church are men, without any ſpeciall priuiledge of not erring, 2. that at the leaſt, the particuler teachers, which tell the Papiſts that ſuch, and ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills haue allowed theſe bookes for ſcripture, are men that may erre; 3. And indeede what ground hath any learned Papiſt, that there haue bene ſuch Councils, but the authority of men? 4. Whereupon can any vnlearned Papiſt relie for the interpretation of the decrees of the Councils, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Greeke or Latine (as all are) but the credit of men? 5. Nay more then that, who can tell what the ſignification of the Hebrew, and Greeke words is, euen in the Bible, but by the report of men? So that it may more truly be ſaide of the Papiſts, then of the Proteſtants, that they build their faith vpon the credit of men: yea the Papiſts do properly, and wholy rely vpon men, viz. the <hi>Pope,</hi> and his <hi>Priests;</hi> becauſe they beleeue, not by their miniſtery, as Chriſtians, but by their authority, like Pythagoreans.<note place="margin">B.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But ſhortely to make an anſwere to his reaſon, if by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying vpon the miniſters credit</hi> he meane that they haue no<note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> ground to build vpon, but that, I deny his Aſſumption. For the vnlearned Proteſtant reſts vpon the witnes of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which perſwadeth him of the generall truth contained in the tranſlation, and directeth him to, and in the triall of particulars. If to the credit of the miniſter, he add the witnes<note place="margin">To the Propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of the ſpirit, I ſay the Propoſition is falſe, for he hath true faith, that relies on the Credit of the miniſter being directed by the ſpirit of God, ſo to do; If this ſeeme ſtrange to any papiſt, let him remember, that popiſh faith requires no leſſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20998:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> reuelation, then the beleefe of Proteſtants; for, according to their doctrine, no man is perſwaded of the truth of the ſcripture, either for the text, or the interpretation, but by the eſpeciall grace of the ſpirit, vſing (as they ſay) the argument of the Churches authority, to beget faith in the heart: only we ſay, the ſpirit vſeth not the authority, but the miniſtry of the Church, to perſwade withall. They affirme that men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, becauſe of the Churches authority, the ſpirit directing and inclining them, to reſt therevpon. Our opinion is that the credit of the miniſter relies on his doctrine: They teach that the credit of the doctrine ariſeth from the miniſter. And yet they cannot, but confeſſe that euery miniſter, and all (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Pope) may erre, in matters of greateſt ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>We confeſſe in deede that men may erre both in poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,<note place="margin">C.</note> and euent. But that the whole catholick Church may erre, no Proteſtant euer taught, or thought.

The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, you ſay, ground their faith vpon the Bible tranſlated into Engliſh. And the Papiſts ſay I build theirs vpon the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſlated into latine, or ſimply vpon the word of him. that preacheth vnto them. They are bound vpon paine of damnation, to beleeue, that the Pope is Chriſts vicar, and cannot erre; But how ſhall I know, that the Pope teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this doctrine? vpon what ground is this beleefe built? vpon the credit of him, that tells them ſo?

But firſt it is to be obſerued that the Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>They are made one body by participating,</hi> but <hi>That they which participate, are one body,</hi> Secondly we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the faithfull are not one body <hi>Cârnally,</hi> but <hi>Spiritually;</hi> To the which it is ſufficient, that Chriſt be <hi>Spiritually</hi> receaued; and therefore the Apoſtle calles it <hi>Bread.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly who knowes not, that all that can receaue, any benefit by the Sacrament of our Sauiour Chriſts body, and bloud, are before members of his myſticall body?

               <p>If the communion of ſaints, beleeued in the Creed, belong to the catholicke Church, in the ſame Creed, How can it implie any fellowſhip with thoſe, that are departed, whether they be in heauen or in purgatory? For by the catholicke Church our papiſts vnderſtand not the church triumphant, but militant only; for they hold, that the catholick church, mentioned in the Creed, muſt alwaies be viſible and famous. And what an vnworthy wrong is it to Chriſt, and his ſaints in Heauen, for any man to imagine, that the Reprobate in earth, of whom there is no ſmall ſtore, in the outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, do communicate with the elect departed in the priuiledges, which Chriſt hath purchaſed, by his precious bloud, for his owne members? But the beſt is, malice it ſelfe, dare not charge vs with ſimple denying all communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Saints in Heauen, and them in earth, but only with the deniall of it, in ſome few points.

               <p>Need I to write one word in anſwere to this reaſon? but I am deſirous that all men ſhould ſee the weakeneſſe of this proofe.

               <p>Secondly no Papiſt, that euer I read, confounds Angells with Saints, or interprets the communion of ſaints, by the miniſtery of Angells.</p>

If we may not, then the Lords prayer is taught vs in vaine, becauſe that cannot belong to any Angel, or ſaint. If we may; I aske why not at one time, as wel as at another? Why not in one matter, as wel as in an other? Vrge not your carnall compariſon betwixt God, and earthly Princes; for both it is as forcible for one time, and matter, as another, and thereby you rob God of the glory, and thankes he ſhould receaue of vs, for the granting of our requeſts; and vs of the comfort, we might haue, by the feeling perſwaſion of Gods loue, in hearing our praiers, and ſatisfiing our deſires.</p>

               <p>As for the places in the Margine, no blaſt, be it neuer ſo great, can kindle the fire of purgatory, by any heate, that<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Then it ſhould ſeeme the meaning of the Article is: that we beleeue the remiſſion of ſinnes, as an effect of Baptiſme: I maruell how many popiſh Prieſts would giue a man this expoſition, that ſhould aske them the meaning of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Creed? There is more reaſon to ſay, I beleeue that remiſſion of ſinnes is a priuiledge belonging to the holy Catholicke church, which our Sauiour Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his bloud. But if the meaning be of Baptiſme, then we haue found in the Creed that Baptiſme is a Sacrament, which a little afore was denyed, to ſhew the inſufficiencie of the Creed, to be the rule, and limit of our beleefe. He that confeſſes, that Ieſus Chriſt hath paide the ranſome for the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20998:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſinnes of his church, by his bloud, and procured the pardon of them, cannot iuſtly be charged with denying this article of remiſſion, howſoeuer he do erre in iudging of the force, and vſe of baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Proteſtants</hi> (ſay you) <hi>acknowledge not remiſſion of ſinnes, as an effect, of the Sacrament of Baptiſme,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proteſtants acknowledge the ſame effect, in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptiſme, which the church of God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and receaued in the ſacrament of circumciſion; that the Patriarches, and fathers of Chriſts church, before his comming receaued the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, no Chriſtian can doubt; that either they had it by the effect of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that your ſacrament hath another effect, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then theirs had, no Papiſt can proue; at leaſt, this man hath not proued. But, ſhortly to deliuer our opinion; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and profeſſe, that euery one, who is effectually bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hath receaued forgiueneſſe of all his ſinnes, originall actuall; paſt, to come, and if you will, mortall, and veniall; for the guilt, and for the puniſhment, for the eternall, and temporall puniſhment. But we deny, firſt, that al, which haue <hi>Baptiſmum Fluminis,</hi> the baptiſme of water, haue alſo <hi>Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Flaminis</hi> the baptiſme of the ſpirit. Secondly that none haue forgiueneſſe, but they, which are baptiſed. Thirdly that euery man that is baptiſed, receaues forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, which may thus appeare, becauſe many a man baptiſed is euerlaſtingly damned; but no man, that hath his ſinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen him, is damned. If you ſay they were forgiuen, but now are not, you deſtroy the nature of forgiueneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which depends not vpon any condition to come. If it do, then can it not be truly affirmed, that a man by Baptiſme receaues forgiueneſſe abſolutely of thoſe ſinnes, which are paſt, and yet that is your doctrine. If you anſwere, that all ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptiſme are abſolutely pardoned; then it may come to paſſe, that a damned man may haue more ſinnes forgiuen him, then one that is ſaued; that a man may haue 10000. ſinnes forgiuen him, and be damned, for all that; for ſome
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20998:24"/> one, Which is euident in the example of a man baptiſed, in the end of his life; who yet, after baptiſme, committs ſome deadly ſinne without repentance: as if, in his going from the Font he fall out with ſome man, and preſently kill, and be killed, not hauing any thought of receiuing abſolution, by the ſacrament of penance. Therefore baptiſme is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accompanied with remiſſion of ſinnes. Now that ſome obtaine forgiueneſſe of ſinne, that neuer are baptiſed, the Papiſts themſelues graunt, in two caſes at the leaſt: For they teach, that <hi>votum baptiſmi,</hi> the purpoſe to be baptiſed is ſufficient, when the thing it ſelfe cannot be had, and that martirdome is inſteed of Baptiſme. Both theſe caſes are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant of ſcripture, if we hold a neceſſitie of Baptiſme abſolutely to iuſtification, as they do; but yet this they teach, be it true, or falſe; Baptiſme is indeed the <hi>Lauer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> becauſe all they that are baptiſed, and none but they, are regenerate: But we vnderſtand not by baptiſme, the <hi>outward</hi> waſhing only, but the <hi>inward</hi> eſpecially; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that is nothing but a ſigne, and a ſeale: yet ſuch a ſigne, and ſeale, as by the grace of Gods ſpirit, confirmes the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſoule in the true beliefe of remiſſion of ſinnes. Many are ſaued, that neuer were baptiſed; many haue beene bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, that neuer ſhall be ſaued: therefore baptiſme is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and force, <hi>the Lauer of regeneration,</hi> to thoſe only, that are ſaued, to all other it is the ſigne without the thing; by reaſon, that they receaue not grace, as well as water.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sacrament of Penance</hi> is a fancie of men. Our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 23. ordaines no ſuch Sacrament, but onely promiſes, that the worke of the Miniſterie ſhalbe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to the remitting, and reteining of ſinnes: and indeed there is no ſacrament of ordinarie vſe in the Church, which Chriſt himſelfe did not either receiue, or giue. If you will ſay that Penance could not belong to him, becauſe he neuer ſinned after Baptiſme; I will affirme, with as good
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20998:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> reaſon, that no more did Baptiſme, becauſe he neuer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at all; for Baptiſme, as you here teach, is <hi>the Lauer of Regeneration,</hi> for that in it, the ſoule dead by ſinne, is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie regenerated by Grace. But Chriſts ſoule was neuer dead, neither indeed doth the Sacrament of penance ſerue for any purpoſe to him, who is waſhed from all his ſinnes, by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, as all truely baptiſed are.</p>
               <p>What Proteſtant euer denyed that our ſinnes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly forgiuen, or what Papiſt can better tell what it is, to haue ſinnes forgiuen, then the holy Ghoſt in Scripture? who affirmes, that reconciliation with God is made, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſinnes not imputed.

               <p>Therefore we do not ſeeke to couer our ſinne with any vaile, but profeſſe, that it is truely, properly, and perfectly pardoned. But we deny (that which this man ſeemes not to vnderſtand) that by forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, originall, and actuall ſinne is wholy, and at once deſtroyed in vs; the ſtrength of it is abated, yea the deadly wound is giuen to it, ſo that it ſhall neuer recouer: but yet (weake though it be, and drawing on to the very point of death) it is the ſame thing it was before. Therefore whatſoeuer can belong to the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, concerning the nature thereof, we acknowledge and profeſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we cannot (contrary to all experience and warrant of Scripture, yea to the very nature<note place="margin">Nom. 7. 23.</note> of a pardon) fancie to our ſelues an abſolute deliuerance from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the being of ſinne.</p>

               <p>The firſt of theſe 5. points. was charged vpon vs, as an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour<note place="margin">N.</note> in 2. reſpects. becauſe both we denie that interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Article, which the Papiſts haue deuiſed, and alſo refuſe the doctrine of viſible famouſnes, which they would thruſt vpon the church. This laſt point is altogeather of the ſame kinde; which I note the rather; becauſe both this, and that, are deliuered in ſuch a phraſe, as the ſcripture knowes not. To beleeue the <hi>Catholick church,</hi> to <hi>deſcend into hell,</hi> are ſpeeches, with which the ſcriptures are not acquainted: and this is another reaſon, why learned Diuines the rather perſwade themſelues, that this Creed was not of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles penning. Yet do not we deny the truth of either of theſe articles, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t only that erroneous interpretation, which the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20998:27"/> Papiſts make of them. Of the former I haue already ſpoken; now let vs ſhortly examine the latter. Firſt we ſay the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh word <hi>Hell</hi> doth not expreſſe the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">

               </lg>
               <p>Secondly it is to be known, that diuers Creeds haue not this article in them; which proues that it was thought either to be compriſed in ſome of the other, or els not to be any matter of faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it muſt be obſerued, that ſome of the ancient writers, haue vnderſtood it of our Sauiours buryall, as <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> hee in plaine termes auouching that it was not to bee found in the <hi>Romane Creed,</hi> and that the meaning of it ſeemed to be nothing els, but that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, or laied in his graue. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> indeed hath the words; but that hee takes them to ſignifie his buriall, may appeare; for that he leaues out all other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of his buriall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly it muſt be remembred, that the maintayners of Chriſts going really into hell, agree not about the matter, whether he went into the place of the damned, or only into the ſuburbes of it, <hi>in limbum patrum,</hi> or <hi>Infantum;</hi> nor about the end.</p>
               <p>Fiftely we haue great reaſon to refuſe this <hi>ſenſe</hi> which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20998:28"/> hath no ground of Scripture, wherevpon it can be built, as diuers of our writers haue plainely ſhewed, and as I could, and would prooue, if it agreed with this courſe of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>Sixthly we affirme, that if we ſhall follow the nature of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we cannot expound it of the place, of the damned, vnleſſe it be apparant that the matter neceſſarilie requires it, which alſo is to be ſaid of the Hebrew <hi>Sheoll,</hi> commonly in the Bible tranſlated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Bucer, Carlile,</hi> and <hi>Broughton</hi> haue ſhewed by particular induction.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly we muſt note this mans dealing, that makes choiſe of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt interpretation as he accompt it; whereas he cannot be ignorant, both that there are diuers other, and that many Proteſtants do m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſlike this, which he brings: as if he would make the world beleeue, that we allow not of this peece of the Creed, but onely in that ſenſe: howbeit many of our diuines, do rather expound it of our Sauiours ſubiection to death, or of the truth of his death, fully ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, not onely by his buriall, but by his being altogether in the ſtate of the dead, his body, and ſoule being ſeuered, and ſeuerally ſo diſpoſed of, as all other dead mens bodies, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ules are; without any ſpeciall ſignifying of the place, whether his ſoule went. But howſoeuer we diſſent from our bretheren, in the meaning of this Article, we allow the doctrine as good, and ſound. For we beleeue, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, being by imputation a ſinner, though of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt holy and pure, ſuffred in his ſoule the wrath of God, due to vs ſinners, and for our ſinnes in ſuch ſort and meaſure, as God had appointed, and as without ſinne, in a finite time it could be ſuffred.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe horrible plaſphemies, which are ſayde to be included in the paines of hell, we neither auouch them all of our Sauiour Chriſt, nor acknowledge that they neſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily accompany the wrath of God, as in handling the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars it will appeare.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:20998:28"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bare the wrath of God. Therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of his ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſequence is falſe: for he knew that God loued his perſon, being his ſonne, and therefore that this <hi>wrath</hi> ſhould not be perpetuall; though the preſent ſenſe of it wrung from him that lamentable exclamation, <hi>My God my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> and alſo that by the, power of his Godhead, he was to free himſelfe from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in death, which, but for theſe reaſons, he muſt needs haue indured, and which for a time he did taſte, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head as it were withdrawing it ſelfe, that the manhood might ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuffred the wrath of God; therefore God hated him, and he God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the latter clauſe I ſhall need to ſay nothing, hauing before reſtrained Chriſts ſufferings to that maner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is without ſinne. Neither is that <hi>hatred of God,</hi> an effect of his wrath in the damned, in whom it is naturall: but by his wrath againſt them, that malice of theirs acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally is increaſed. Which I ſpeake vpon this ſuppoſition, that the damned ſhall continue in ſinne, as well as in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>The former point, if we hold the former diſtinction ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly, contaynes at all no blaſphemy againſt our ſauiour: his perſon was, of it ſelfe, moſt tenderly beloued of God his father, though beeing conſidered as a ſinner, (ſuch as by imputation hee was in the ſight of God) for a time, in that reſpect hee was to God for vs, as euery one of vs is in himſelfe to God.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:20998:29"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ ſuffered</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the wrath of God; therefore he was tormented with anguiſh of minde for his offences, for which &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſequence ſhould haue bin. <hi>Therefore he was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with anguiſh of mind for thoſe offences, for which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the wrath of God,</hi> But thoſe were not his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ours. Ours I ſay, truly, and properly; h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s only by imputation. And it is no blaſphemy to hold, that Chriſt ſo, as he was a ſinner, and puniſhed for ſinne, had alſo anguiſh of minde for ſinne; not for his owne (there was no ſuſpicion, or likeneſſe of ſinne in him) but for ours, which by his conſent, was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on him; for the time, he ſaw the angry countenance of God againſt him, and hee knewe that our ſinnes had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the continuance of it for euer. But the comforts I ſpake of before, vpheld him from all daunger of deſpay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and deliuered him from that perpetuity of torment, in which otherwiſe, hauing taken vpon him our Perſon, hee ſhould haue remained. Now this ſo being, we need not feare theſe thunder-bolts of horrible blaſphemy; although wee beleeue that Chriſt our ſauiour did, for a time, indure in his ſoule the wrath of God, which was due to our ſinnes. Neither doe we hereby make God the enemie of God, nor of the humanitie of Ieſus Chriſt, which he euer moſt entirely loued, but only auouch, that God truly hated, and puniſht our ſinnes, in his owne ſonne, with ſuch a kinde, and meaſure of his wrath, as being true, and iuſt, was euery way without ſinne, and finite in regard of the time. ſo that I take the Doctrine to be voide of blaſphemy; howſoeuer the meaning of the Article bee conceiu'd.</p>

               <p>5. The Puritans blaſphemouſly pronounce, and ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defende, that Chriſt ſuffred the paines of hell, vpon the croſſe; and that in this paſſionful agony, &amp; agonizing griefe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20998:31"/> did principally conſiſt the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of man, from thoſe eternall torments of hell, And thinke you this is a trifle, a rite, or ceremonie? This faith the Puritans profeſſe; this blaſphemie the Proteſtants deteſt.</p>
               <p>The deſcenſion of Chriſt to hell is (no doubt) but a trifle, a ceremonie, a matter of ſmall importance. It is but an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our creed; and yet this article the puritanes really deny; the which al Proteſtants ſtedfaſtly beleeue.</p>
               <p>That the ſecond perſon in Trinitie receaued his diuinitie from his father, is but a trifle, a point not much materiall to our beleefe; and yet, if this bee denied, the myſterie of the holy trinitie can not bee beleeued; for it abſolutely taketh away the nature of a ſonne, and conſequently the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proceſsion of the ſecond perſon, and ſo ouerthroweth all the myſterie of the Trinitie. This principall part of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianitie, Proteſtants approue and Puritans improue.</p>
               <p>I omit here many more petty differences, in matters of faith; the which were ſufficient to make them condemne one another, not onely in accidents, and ceremonies, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſubſtance, and principall partes of religion. As in that the Preciſians denie, that in Baptiſme our ſinnes bee remitted, but onely take it for a ſeale of that grace, God gaue them by his eternal election. The Proteſtants confeſſe, that in the ſacrament we are waſhed by Gods ſpirite from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne.</p>
               <p>The Puritans condemne the Communion booke, as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and erroneous. The Proteſtants commend it as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall and religious. The Proteſtants vſe the croſſe in baptiſme, as a holy ſigne fitt for the profeſsion of Chriſts faith, and religion: The Puritanes exclaime againſt it, as a humane inuention, and a point of ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants defend, that impoſition of handes, in confirmation, is a ſigne of the fauour, and goodnes of God towards them: The Puritans auouch, that this is a flat lie, &amp; that they teſtifie therein, that God doth that, he neuer did.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:20998:31"/>
               <p>The Proteſtants in fine will vſe Veſtments, Muſicke, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes, ſurpliſſes, and diuerſe other ceremonies, in diuine ſeruice, and adminiſtration of ſacraments: all which the puritanes condemne, as will worſhip, and not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by God, to bee ſuperſtitious. All theſe (I ſay) I omitt, and many more, which are to bee ſeene in the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes ſupplication to the Parliament, where 32. differences are aſsigned; and onely haue thought good to aduertiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery diſcreete Proteſtant, to conſider the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. precedent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. For there is neuer a one of them, which the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane defendeth not to bee a matter of faith; and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is bound in conſcience to condemne him, for obſtinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintayning the contrarie, to bee an heretick: and the reaſon is euident; for the rule, and ſquare the Proteſtants, and Puritanes both hould to know an hereſie, is this; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is contrarie to Gods word is an hereſie, if it be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended: but all the aforeſaid 7. points in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, are by the one part proued contrary to Gods word, and by the other auouched to bee grounded vpon the ſame. Therefore we may well conclude, that if one error in faith with obſtinacy defended, ſufficeth to make an heretick, what ſhall we iudge of the Puritan, who ſo mainely defendeth ſo manie? Surelie this I will auer, that they differ in ſubſtance of religion, and not only in accidents, and ceremonies.</p>
               <p>And finally, they haue no argument to proue, that they<note place="margin">C.</note> haue the true Church, true religion, true faith; which al he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, that euer were, will not bring to condemne the Church of Chriſt, as well as they. For example they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſcriptures, ſo did the Arrians: they contemne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills; the Arrians did not regard them. They challenge to themſelues the true interpretation: the ſame did all hereticks to this day. And to conclude, they call themſelues the litle flock of Chriſt, to whom God hath reuealed his truth, and illuminated them from aboue: all which the Donatiſts, with as good reaſon, and better arguments, did arrogate vnto themſelues. The ſame I ſay of the Pelagians, Neſtorians,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20998:32"/> Eutychians, with all the rable of other damned hereticks.</p>
               <p>And to conclude theſe articles of faith, I ſay, that if the<note place="margin">D</note> principles of the Proteſtants religion be true, <hi>S. Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe exhorteth vs to infidelitie; which I proue thus:</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer exhorteth vs to doubt of that, which we are bound to beleeue by faith, exhorteth vs to infidelitie.</p>
               <p>But <hi>S. Paule</hi> doth exhort vs to doubt of our ſaluation, which we are bound to beleeue by faith, according to the Proteſtants religion. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>S. Paule</hi> exhorteth vs to infidelitie.</p>
               <p>The Maior is plaine, for to doubt of matters in faith, is manifeſt infidelitie: becauſe whoſoeuer doubteth, whether God hath reuealed that, which indeed he hath reuealed, being ſufficiently propoſed, as reuealed; virtuallie doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, whether God ſaith trueth, or lyeth.</p>

Is it not more for the glory of God, and good of the Church, that there ſhould be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall diſagreement about matters of Religion, then that all ſhould beleeue and maintaine falſe doctrine?

So then this propoſition, that we haue no ſuch meanes, as the Papiſts haue, to end controuerſies, neither diſproues, nor diſgraces our church. But it is worth the doing, to take a view of this rhetoricall declamation, rather then Logicall diſputation, which was promiſt; by ſtripping it out of this braucry, and ſetting it naked, before the light of true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Thus then he diſputes;</p>

For it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible, to vnderſtand the true meaning thereof, in moſt places, and ſo to prooue it, by the Analogie of faith, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon euident Textes, and by the examining of the Texts that are in queſtion, that a reaſonable man ſhall not be able to with-hould his aſſent, without manifeſt blindneſſe, if not wilfulneſſe.

               <p>When it is proued, that the Church cannot erre, then the<note place="margin">To the proofe of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> propoſition ſhalbe granted: but till then, it deſerues no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; and if it be granted: yet what hereticall church may not haue the ſame quietneſſe, vpon the ſame perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Indeed one of the three points, euen that, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſtand moſt vpon, viz. <hi>their outward quiet eſtate,</hi> may in part, enſue vpon this beleefe, though it be moſt erroneous. For this perſwaſion <hi>that the Church cannot erre,</hi> is ſufficient to ſtay all controuerſies, when the Church hath ſhewed her opinion of them. And yet it is with them only ſufficient, that acknowledge this falſe priuiledge of the church: &amp; therfore it follows but in part: becauſe you muſt firſt perſwade thoſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20998:33"/> that contend, of the truth of this aſſertion, ere you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worke by it, vpon their conſciences. So that although this meanes (ſuppoſing the truth of it) be in it ſelfe effectuall: yet it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not breed this effect in all, that at any time contend about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but in thoſe only, that beleeue it. For example; put caſe that ſome of the Church, being perſwaded, that the Church hath not authoritie to rob the people of the Cup, ſhould call this priuiledge of erring into queſtion. How will your Church take vp this controuerſie? will ſhee vrge the concluſion, <hi>I cannot erre?</hi> or will ſhee procure her Biſhops, Abbots, Cardinals, &amp;c. to auouch aſmuch of her. What is this, but <hi>Aſke my fellowe, if I bee a theefe.</hi> Yes, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worſe: for it is all one, as if he that is arraigned for fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, ſhould ſay, <hi>I tell you, I am not a theefe:</hi> were he not worthy to be acquited, trow you? And ſuch would your proofe be, in this queſtion. But if the Church in this caſe, could bring out a Charter, and plead that for this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: her aduerſaries muſt needs be conuerted, or at leaſt might be confounded: and ſo perhaps the Controuerſie ended. Yet not by the Churches, but by the ſcriptures au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: which, as I muſt hereafter ſhew, is the meanes, that God hath appointed, for that purpoſe; but it may perhaps be<note place="margin">1. Proofe that the Church can not erre. Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To that propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> proued, that the Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre. Let vs heare the reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they, that will not heare the Church, muſt be accounted as Ethnicks, and Publicans, the Church cannot erre: for if the Church could erre, then were there no reaſon, why hee, that would not heare her, ſhould be ſo accounted of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Pope ſendes his Legats with pardons a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging about the Countrie, commaunding them to preach to the people, of the vertue, &amp; efficacie of thoſe indulgences: Are they not as Ethnickes, or Publicans, or worſe, that ſhall refuſe to heare their ſermons? and may I herevpon reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably conclude, that therefore they, that preach them, cannot erre? Why ſhall I not ſay the like, of any Popiſh Prieſt, moncke, or fryer, being authoriſed by the Church of Rome to preach? who can refuſe to heare them, and not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20998:34"/> be guiltie of contempt, againſt your Church Apoſtolicke? yet (I hope) theſe may erre. Wherevpon I conclude, that therefore your propoſion is falſe, if they, that will not heare the Church muſt be accounted as Ethnicks, the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>What? ſimplie, if he do not heare the church? nay, rather<note place="margin">To the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> if, in that caſe ſet downe by our ſauiour, he do not heare her: Now the caſe is this, If one brother, or chriſtian ſinne againſt another, he, that is offended, muſt rebuke the other in priuate betwixt them alone. 2. If this preuaile not with him, he muſt the ſecond time rebuke him and that before one, or two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, 3. If this will not ſerue, he muſt complaine of him to the Gouernours of the Church, 4. If their cenſure will do no good with him, he is to be accounted no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the church after excommunication. Let vs now draw an argument from this place, and ſee what it makes for the churches infinite au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. He, that, being thus proceeded withall, obeyes not the iuſt cenſure of the Gouernours of the church, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of his ſinne, and ſatisfying of his brother, &amp; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, is to be accounted an Ethnicke. Therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the church ſayes muſt be beleeued, or therefore the Church cannot erre. Who ſees not the weakneſſe of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? He, that obeys not the church in a iuſt cenſure, is no longer any member of the Church; Therefore he that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in al things obeies her not, acknowledging that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, is an Infidell.</p>
               <p>Here it would be further conſidered, that by the <hi>Church</hi> in this place, neither a generall council, nor the Pope is ment, but the Gouernours of ſeuerall congregations, or the whole congregations themſelues, whether they be more, or fewer, ſo they be a church: that is of neceſſity more then one. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoeuer can be gathered out of this text, for the churches priuiledge, and ſoueraignty, belongs to the Paſtors, and Rulers of ſeuerall churches. If then by this ſcripture it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20998:34"/> be proued that the church cannot erre, it is proued that the paſtors, and gouernours of ſeuerall charges cannot erre. How then is this the ſpeciall priuiledge of the Pope? But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is a great queſtion, and (I thinke) not eaſie by any Papiſt to be decided: whether the priuiledge of not erring, belong to the Pope, or to the church. If it were giuen to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and his ſucceſſors, why is it made common to them, with the reſt of the church? If it appertaine to the whole church, why is it appropriated to the Pope? If it reſt in the Pope, what becomes of it, <hi>Sede vacante,</hi> when there is no Pope? At ſuch times be like the church may erre; yea and at other times too. For if it be proper to the Pope not to erre, then all beſide the Pope may erre: and ſo it may come to paſſe, that there ſhalbe no church in the world: becauſe the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, if he be neuer ſo great a head, is but a head: whereas to the being of a church, a body alſo is neceſſary and not a head only.</p>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>What Church meane you? not the Pope? for he hath not this priuiledge, as he is a Paſtor, or Doctor, but as he is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor: nor the congregation: for the people both may, and doe erre. What then? Theſe Paſtors, and Doctors? But they are not all Popes. I trow, that they ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, from poſſibility of erring.</p>
               <p>It was indeed Gods purpoſe in giuing Paſtors, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors that his children, which only are the Church, ſhould be inſtructed, and eſtabliſhed in all truth: and accordingly it comes to paſſe in matters of ſubſtance, and foundation:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20998:35"/> but this is done by little and little, as the Apoſtle witneſſes in this place, knowledge being not perfect all at once, but firſt beginning, as in children, then by degrees receauing a continual increaſe, <hi>till we come to the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Christ:</hi> which is neuer found in any, while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>Firſt our Sauiour in this place, enforces not vpon this guift of the ſpirit, any neceſſitie of hearing whatſoeuer the Church ſhall deliuer, but only makes this promiſe, by way of comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this promiſe is made, not to the church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, but to the Apoſtles in particular.</p>
               <p>Thirdly is is made not onely to them all ioyntly, but alſo to euery one of them ſeuerally. So that if by this place any thing can be concluded for the Church at this daye; euery particular Paſtor, or Miniſter, may claime this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of not erring, and beyng heard, whatſoeuer he teach: which being moſt abſurde, and impious; that charge to heare, and penalty for not hearing, belongs ſimply to the Apoſtles only, and to euery one of them, whom the ſpirit of God infalliblie kept from erring: To all others, ſo far forth, as that, which they teach, is agreeable to the word, which the Lord by his Apoſtles hath left, and commended to his Church. Therefore howſoeuer the perſwaſion that the Church cannot erre, may ſometimes breed an outward qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, in the Church: yet it hath no force to eſtabliſh men in the vnitie of true beleefe: ſince it may both deceaue, and be deceaued; not to end controuerſies, becauſe all beleeue it not; nor to aboliſh Hereſies, which, many times it may fauour.</p>
               <p>But what is it, that he addes, concerning generall Councills, and auncient Fathers? Haue they ſome priuilege, the Church hath not? Or is it his meaning to exemplifie that in particular, which before he wrote in generall, of the impoſſibility, that the church ſhould erre? If it be, then all he ſayes of theſe (for he brings no new reaſon) is already anſwered, in trying the Churches title, to that feigned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue. But cannot generall Councils deliuer falſe, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? How chaunce then; that ſome wholly, others in

For, that which is added of their teaching on truth with ioynt conſent, is but to bleare the eyes of the ignorant. Can there bee more ioynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then in generall Councills? may they erre, when they ſeeke the truth, with graue, and ſerious aduiſe, in great multitudes, and can they not be deceaued when they enquire after it, priuately in their ſeuerall ſtudies? who knowes not, that the error of ſome one man renowned for learning, and Godlines, drawes whole Churches after it many times? eſpecially ſince cuſtome like a tyrant, rules o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the witts, and wills euen of learned men: who oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thinke it more diſcretion, to retaine a ſmall error with quietnes, then to reſtore the truth with great trouble, and hazard.</p>

               <p>Therefore, though we refuſe not to make triall of our doctrine, by the Fathers writings, namely thoſe that are indeed auntient, in the firſt 600. yeeres, before the kingdome of Anthichriſt: Yet we receaue them, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the truth, not Iudges; and vſe them, as we vſe old Coines, not for an aſſay, to trye by them, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes of met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where they ſpeake according to Scripture, we acknowledge the good graces of God in them, to their deſerued Commendation: Where they write of themſelues, we obſerue examples of mans frailety, and ignorance, to which we make no doubt, but all writers, ſince the Apoſtles, and except them, haue bin, are, and ſhalbe ſubiect.</p>
               <p>To what tryall then ſhall we be take our cauſe? To what elſe but to the Scriptures of God? Would a man thinke, there ſhould be any profeſſed Chriſtian found, that would miſlike of this courſe? And yet our Papiſtes doe.</p>
               <p>They cannot abide to heare, that the ſole Scripture ſhould be vmpere, and iudge, in matters of controuerſie: Belike they haue found a better: Euen the <hi>Pope,</hi> to whome they attribute more, whatſoeuer they talke of the Church, Councills, and Fathers, then to all three together; ſaue that by Church perhaps they meane the Pope, Whom they make the head, and husband of it, being not afraide blaſphemouſly to write, that all the names that are giuen to Chriſt, as he is ouer the Church, belong to the Pope, as well as to Chriſt; though at the ſecond hand, as beeing Chriſts; or rather (as they ſay) Gods vicar. Perhaps they will ſay, as good do ſo, as remit all to euery mans priuat ſpirit, and ſingular expoſition.

When we lacke helpe, we will ſend for their Pope; or, if neede bee, make one of our owne: As yet things are not in ſo deſperat an eſtate, that we ſhould be enforced to ſeeke any ſuch remedie.

               <p>That the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the <hi>Puritans,</hi> (as the Papiſts<note place="margin">B.</note> terme them) differ <hi>in eſſentiall points of faith,</hi> he vndertakes to proue by this reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They, that differ about the Kings ſupremacie, the Biſhops au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, the obſeruation of feaſts, &amp;c. differ in eſſentiall points of</hi>

                  <hi>faith. But the Proteſtants and Puritans differ in theſe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they differ in eſſentiall points of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If, by <hi>eſſentiall points of faith,</hi> all matters of truth in diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be ſignified, we graunt his concluſion; adding further, that the church was neuer yet ſo happy, as to be without difference of opinions amongſt diuines, in any one age, ſince the beginning of chriſtian Religion. If he meane, by theſe words, ſuch things as are neceſſarilie to be beleeued to ſaluation, or to the profeſſion of chriſtianitie, I deny his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in all, or the moſt part of it, as, in handling the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars it ſhall appeare. That the Proteſtants hold the kings ſupremacie to be an <hi>eſſentiall point of faith,</hi> ſo that he which doubteth of it, cannot be either in truth, or in profeſſion a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20998:37"/> chriſtian: neither the confeſſion of our church; no the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of any of our diuines prooue. Indeed ſeditious Papiſts would beare the world in hand, that their traiterous Prieſts, and Ieſuits, haue beene executed for religion, and not for treaſon, in denying the Kings ſupremacie: but neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, nor Puritan euer yet beleeued them. Both which doe conſtantly, and ioyntly auowe, that although it be not a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of ſo high a nature; yet it is a wicked error, againſt the truth of Gods word, and an opinion not to be tollerated in any Chriſtian, or ciuill ſtate.</p>
               <p>There is no diſſent betwixt the Proteſtant and the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, about the Kings ſupremacie, but the difference that is, ariſeth from the diuers conceit, each part hath of the things, by his Maieſtie enioyned; as it ſhall appeare in due place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caluin</hi> doth not ſo much as charge <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight with aſſuming the Soueraignety he ſpeakes of; but onely layes the fault vpon certaine men; who in an vnconſiderate zeale, as he ſaith, aſcribed ſuch a power to him, as by the word of God is not warrantable. Wherein, theſe two points made him miſlike the matter. Firſt, that he was called <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame head of the Church;</hi> which title being taken from the Pope, and giuen to the King, ſeemed to inueſt that whole power in the Kings perſon, which the Pope had vſurped ouer the church. Secondly, <hi>Stephen Gardiner Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> affirmed at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> that it was lawfull for the King, to forbid eating of fleſh vpon this, or that day, to forbid Prieſts to marry, to take from the people the vſe of the Cup in the Supper of the Lord: The later two whereof are ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnlawfull, the firſt only ſo farre as it concernes putting religion in ſuch abſtinence: of which anon. And, in that ſenſe onely, did <hi>Caluin</hi> denie the Kings ſupremacie, in this point, taking it to be all one with the Popes. What oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Presbyterie of Scotland</hi> hath made againſt the King: I neither know, nor haue now leaſure to ſeeke. But, if they haue done any thing, whereby it may iuſtly be ſuſpected, that they thinke the king hath nothing to do with the kirke,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20998:38"/> they haue gone beyond their bounds, and ſhall neuer haue eyther approbation, or excuſe by my defenſe.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>the Miniſters and people,</hi> which doe not yeeld to ſubſcription, and conformitie, I muſt needs labour to cleere them of this imputation. To which purpoſe, I deſire it may firſt be obſerued, that they acknowledge both by word and writing, and that <hi>ex animo,</hi> not like you Papiſts, with I know not what <hi>aequiuocations,</hi> that the Kings Maieſtie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, is the onely ſupreame Gouernour of this Realme, and of all other his Highneſſe dominions, and countries, as well in all ſpirituall, or Eccleſiaſticall things, or cauſes, as temporall; &amp; that no forraine Prince, perſon, ſtate, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, hath, or ought to haue any iuriſdiction, power, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie, preheminence, or authoritie Eccleſiaſticall, or ſpirituall, within his Maieſties ſaid Realmes, dominions, and countries, according as the ſtatute, agreeablie to the law of God, requireth.</p>
               <p>Secondly they profeſſe, with the reſt of their Fathers, and brethren Proteſtants, that his Maieſtie hath authoritie to commaund, or forbid, in all matters whatſoeuer, neceſſarie, or indifferent: and that, in both theſe, he is to be obeyed, vpon conſcience. Of his authoritie in matters comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God, we are wholy of one minde. About the matters in queſtion, there are theſe two differences. <hi>Whether they be indifferent or no: whether, ſuppoſing them to be indifferent, they may be commaunded, and done, in caſe they be thought to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſuperſtition in many, and to be an occaſion of ſtumbling, and deſtruction to many a one, for whom Chriſt hath dyed.</hi> And theſe are the reaſons, why they dare not (as they ſay) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue ſome things in our church, by ſubſcription, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: otherwiſe profeſſing not onely a willingneſſe, but a deſire to yeeld, if they might ſatiſfie their owne conſciences in theſe doubts. So that indeed they no way deny <hi>the Kings ſupremacie,</hi> either by attributing that to any forrain pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tate, or prelate, or any presbytery at home, which lawfully belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs vnto him, or by denying his authority in things indifferent.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:20998:38"/>
               <p>Concerning the authoritie of Biſhops, it is not an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> point of faith: and beſides, the beſt proteſtant diuines holde, that the forme of gouernment is left to the diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of euery church, to be framed, as the ciuill eſtate may beare it: and therefore it is not denyed (I thinke) that there may be a Presbytery, but that a Presbytery is fit for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie. So that the aboliſhing of Biſhops in ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is not a confounding of Chriſts church, but a diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of one outward forme of gouernment.</p>
               <p>Eſſentiall points of faith are matters of doctrine, wherein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a man may be ſound, and yet faile in ſome parts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If therefore, by <hi>not obſeruing,</hi> you meane, not thinking it lawfull, to obſerue or appoint holy daies, I ſay it is no eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall point of faith to doubt of, or deny this authority; though the Puritans (generally) hold ſuch deniall to be an error.</p>
               <p>If it be your meaning, to charge the Puritans with neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the obſeruation of ſuch daies, I dare be bold to ſay, that all Puritans do more religiouſly obſerue them, then any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt doth the Lords day, or Sunday; which I auowe both of Miniſters and people.</p>
               <p>That it is vnlawfull for the church, or magiſtrat to appoint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>faſts</hi> for the religious humbling of men, vpon iuſt occaſions, it is a foule error for any man to hold, but not againſt any eſſentiall point of faith, required to the being of a chriſtian, either in truth or profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Both Proteſtants &amp; Puritans agree (generally) about this point: as for the weekly fiſh daies, Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; the 4. ember weeks, our church, and ſtate diſclaime the appointing of them, for any vſe of religion, and keepe them only as meanes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the encreaſe of cattell, and mainteinance of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Mariners, Fiſhermen, and Fiſhmongers.</p>
               <p>Neither is this doctrine of Chriſts ſuffrings any eſſentiall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> point of faith, nor blaſphemy, on the one part, or other; as I haue ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ewed before in the fourth article. This makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Proteſtants &amp; Puritants, becauſe many, on either ſide, are of this opinion, many of the contrary.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:20998:39"/>
               <p>Of this I ſay, as of the former; that, taking it in ſuch a ſenſe, as this Papiſt doth, it is no eſſentiall point of faith; but in the true meaning of the article, it is; for it belongs to to the truth of Chriſtian Religion, as a ſubſtantiall point, to hold, that our Sauiour Chriſt was wholly in the eſtate of the dead, both for ſoule, and bodie.</p>
               <p>Of this matter alſoe there is diuerſitie of opinion, betwixt Proteſtants, and Proteſtants, Puritans, and Puritans, and therefore it is fondly, and falſly ſet downe, as a point of diſſent betwixt proteſtants, and Puritans.</p>
               <p>The like anſwere is to be made to this alſo, ſaue onely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that it may be doubted, whether any Proteſtant agree with the Papiſts, in this point or no; generally I am ſure the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, and the Proteſtants are of one opinion in this matter. To hold that Chriſt is God of God, the naturall ſonne of God, coeſſentiall, Coe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ternall to his father, is a matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, at the leaſt ſo, that the Contrary ouerthrowes reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But, for my part, I dare not affirme, that the diſtinct knowledge of all ſuch points, is of neceſſity to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>And ſurely (ſauing other mens better iudgment) I am of opinion, that thoſe Clauſes of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Creed, which ſeeme to ſhut all men out of heauen, that beleeue not thoſe articles of the Creed, are to be vnderſtood of ſome of them onely, or of the Contrary to the truth. The holy, and learned man ſpake according to the occaſion, the hereſie of <hi>Arrius</hi> hauing made a maine difference betwixt the true, and falſe Chriſtians. But of theſe three laſt points, ſee <hi>The fourth Article.</hi>

                  </gap>oats: now followe the petty ones, as hee calls them. The firſt whereof is as true, as the former ſeauen. For our agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the matter of Baptiſme may eaſilie be knowne, by our ioynt conſent, to the articles of Religion 1562. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſubſcription required by ſtatute. Neither do the Puritans deny, that Baptiſme waſheth away all ſinnes, as a Sacrament, and ſeales vp the forgiueneſſe thereof:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20998:39"/> Neither do the proteſtants beleeue any other thing of it, or aſcribe any other vertue to it.</p>
               <p>The Puritanes do not Condemne the communion booke, as irreligious, but acknowledge it lawfull to bee vſed, and both haue vſed it heretofore, and are readie to vſe it againe, howſoeuer they deſire to be forborne in the vſe of ſome things in it, which (to them) ſeeme vnwarrantable.</p>
               <p>They entreate to be ſpared for the Croſſe in Baptiſme, And, whereas diuers of late haue yeelded to it, the ground of their yeelding is, that it is no ſignificant Ceremonie, but onely a ſigne betwixt man, and man, and ſo indifferent as they thinke.</p>
               <p>That there are ſome differences betwixt vs, we deny not, nor that this is one of them, concerning the ſigne in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</hi> But this is farre from being an eſſentiall point of faith.</p>
               <p>And ſo is this of vſing <hi>Veſtiments, Muſicke &amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo there are diuers opinions, on either ſide: but, I thinke, there is no man condemns all theſe, as will worſhip, and ſuperſtitious. Yea there are ſome, called Puritans, that take none of them all, to be either will worſhip, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious; and yet they hold them vnlawfull. In a word, there is not any difference, to my knowledge, betwixt vs, which may either depriue vs of ſaluation by the death of Chriſt, or barre vs from lyuing brotherly, and chriſtianly as members of one, and the ſame Church.</p>
               <p>And thus wee haue heard the ſtrong arguments of this popiſh replyer. Who, it ſhould ſeeme, not reſting much vpon his owne proofe, in the end of this firſt parte, lookes to heare ſome reaſons from vs, whereby we may approue our ſelues, to be the true Church. But that hath bin often donne by our Diuines, ſo far, as we profeſſe of our ſelues. For none of vs euer vndertooke to proue, that we are the true Church, as the Papiſts dreame of the Church. Wee are, by the bleſſing, and grace of God, a part, or member of the true Church of Chriſt, not the,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20998:40"/> whole church. Yea we acknowledge, that diuers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches may refuſe communion with vs. and yet both they; and we, remaine members of the ſame true church: though not without ſome fault, either on both ſides, or at leaſt the one. But the papiſts ſo take to themſelues the name of the church, that they condemne all for ſchiſmatickes yea for Heretikes, that acknowledge not themſelues to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the catholicke Romiſh church, in ſubiection to the Pope of Rome.</p>
               <p>The ſum of our proofe is, that we profeſſe that religion, which our ſauiour Chriſt hath commended vnto vs, in the ſcriptures; of which, it ſhould ſeeme, this man was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. For, in this very place, he excepts againſt this reaſon; becauſe it is no other, then that, which all heretikes wil bring to condemne the church of Chriſt, This anſwere is inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: vnleſſe we ſhall grant that our ſauiour brings no good<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 4. 7.</note> reaſon againſt the Diuill, in alledging ſcripture, becauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than himſelfe in his temptation, replies againſt him by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Who knowes not, that in all controuerſies, reaſons muſt be drawen from the arts of which the controuerſie is: as for example, what Lawyer will offer to defend a bad cauſe, but he will quote lawe, for his purpoſe? and ſhall this either bar him, that pleads againſt him, from alleging his bookes, or make his plea of no force? nay rather any man of meane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, will readily diſtinguiſh, and ſay, the one makes a ſhew of law but the other hath law indeed; ſo is it in theſe points of controuerſie. The Papiſts, and other heretikes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the ſcriptures make for them, but this may not preiudice the authority thereof, in deciding matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie: neither ſhall any true chriſtian need to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſeeking to ground his faith vpon the ſcriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Heretikes abuſe them to their wicked purpoſes: no more then our ſauiour was to alleage them, though the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill had drawen them to abett his horrible temptation. Nay, if the Papiſts were not too willfull, they would, in dyuers points, acknowledge the voice of God in ſcriptures, it being
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20998:40"/> plaine, as theſe allegations of our Sauiour Chriſt. And, if they had bin then in the Diuils ſteed, they would not haue taken thoſe places for ſatisfaction, but would haue come vpon our ſauiour with a ſecond reply, of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and haue charged him with falſifying the text, for putting in <hi>Onely.</hi> Therefore we acknowledge this to be our onely hould, that by the Scriptures we are proued to be the Church of God. Let the <hi>Arrians</hi> comtemne <hi>Councills;</hi> We beleeue, and profeſſe, that they are excellent meanes allowed by God, for maintaining, and ſearching out the truth; only we refuſe to match them in Authoritie, and accompt, with the vnfallible truth of the almighty God Will any abſurd, and baſe flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer affirme, that he deſpiſes Magiſtracy, and Princes who denyes, that they haue an abſolute and infinite Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie?</p>
               <p>But, I thinke, it would ſhrewdly trouble you to proue, that the <hi>Arrians</hi> contemned <hi>Councills.</hi> Sure it is not likely, ſince themſelues, within the compaſſe of 30. yeares, held 10. Councills, at the leaſt, for the eſtabliſhing of their wicked hereſie. True it is, that they reiected the councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> wherein their hereſie was iuſtly and holyly condemned; but that therefore they regarded not Councills at all, it is not proued. But conſider, I pray you, with what conſcience, or rather with what malice, you write. The <hi>Arrians</hi> are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by you, for not regarding Councils; we are charged to contemne them. Where as you know, in your owne conſcience, that we receaue both that Councill which the <hi>Arrians</hi> refuſed, and all the other generall, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler councills, ſaue thoſe, that (as we are perſwaded) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne in them apparaunt falſhood, and impietie. If it bee a fault not to receaue all, who ſhall excuſe you Papiſts, that haue wholly reiected ſeauen generall Councills held at <hi>Antioch, Millaine, Ariminum, Epheſus</hi> the ſecond, two at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt Images, and one at <hi>Piſa:</hi> and in part ſixe other, at <hi>Sardis,</hi> at <hi>Syrmium,</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> in <hi>Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:20998:87"/> how iuſtly all, or ſome of theſe are reiected, I diſpute not, once it is euident they are reiected, neither haue we any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to regard your ſhifting defences, concerning the Popes authority, in whom, for ſooth, it lies, to allow or diſallowe of Councils. For this is but to beg the queſtion. Therefore, to make ſhort, we willingly and reuerently embrace all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and all Canons, and articles of all Councills, ſo far forth, as they agree with the word of God; not becauſe of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but by reaſon of the truth of thoſe things, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcriptures, is in them declared, &amp; commended to all chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Neither do we hereby challenge to our ſelues the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of ſcriptures, as if it were appropriated vnto vs. That is your Popiſh Hereſie. Nay we acknowledge, with thankes to God, and their iuſt commendation, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers haue brought great light to the true vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſcriptures. Yea that many Papiſts haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted ſome texts of ſcripture ſoundly, &amp; religiouſly. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer we confeſſe, that all, and euery one of our writers, either hath, or may haue failed in his expoſitions. I ſpeake the laſt doubtfully, becauſe ſome haue written but little, and my ſelfe haue not examined all.</p>
               <p>If any Heretikes avow the truth of al their owne interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, what ſhould this preiudice our cauſe? Who ſubmitt whatſoeuer our expoſitions to be compared with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; to be receaued, or refuſed, as they ſhalbe found to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or diſagree with, or from the word of God. I would add hereunto the generall conſent of the ancient writers; but that it is a longer, and more vncertaine courſe, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſutable vnto their owne writings, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be framed according to the holy Ghoſts meaning. For the maine doubt muſt needs accompany that tryall. viz. who ſhalbe Iudge, whether we, or the Papiſts rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and expounde the fathers wrytings? If any man ſhall ſay their Bookes, and Commentaries are plaine, and eaſie; I dare boldly ſay of him, that either he neuer
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20998:87"/> read, what they write, or cares not, what himſelfe ſayes. It wil not ſerue the turne, to bring ſome plaine interpretations out of them, for ſo can we alleage very many texts out of the Scripture. But he, that is deſirous to iudge truly of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any writer, muſt not ſnatch vp a ſentence here, and there, but aduiſedly conſider both his manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in other places, and the ſignification of diuers phraſes, and cuſtome of ſpeech, in thoſe times, wherin he writ, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of thoſe particular words, he would vnderſtand, and diuers other ſuch points. Which will proue (as ere while I ſaid) more troubleſome, and leſſe certaine, then to ſearch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery corner of the text, for the true meaning of the ſcripture. And here, let vs remember, that we are ſure the ſcripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with it ſelfe, in euery place, and point: that any other writers do ſo, who can be aſſured? So that, many times, we ſhall beat our braines to reconcile thoſe ſpeeches, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are very certaine contrarieties Since that this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie remaines in vnderſtanding the fathers writings, which is the onely doubt in the ſcripture, what madneſſe were it, to leaue beating of the text, wherein we know the certaine truth is to be found; and to run ryot in the wilde-feilds of mens inuentions, where perhaps there is nothing to be had but errour. Let vs vſe the helpe of Ancient writers to finde the meaning of the holy Ghoſt; but not reſt vpon their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority therein. If they proue their interpretations by reaſon, let it be waighed, that it may perſwade vs to think, as they do. If there be none, let vs labour to find ſome for their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. If that will be not, let vs ſee what other reaſon we can haue, of any other expoſition. If it pleaſe God to ſhew vs any, Let vs craue pardon of the Fathers to diſſent from them: if none, Let vs rather truſt them, then our ſelues, where there is nothing, but coniecture, without difference of likelyhood.</p>
               <p>We are far from bragging of any ſuch ſpeciall illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> challenged to themſelues. For we ſay not, that the Church of God is only in our aſſemblies or the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20998:88"/> ſpirit tyed to vs. Who knowes not, that this is a ſtale popiſh deuiſe, to ſhutt vp the holy Ghoſt in the Popes breſt; ſo that neither all Councills, without him, can be any thing worth, and hee, of himſelfe, without any of them, is alſufficient.

But we are not aſhamed of our ſmall nomber: though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts twight vs with all, in compariſon of their huge mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes.</p>
               <p>Therefore, whereas this Papiſt likens vs to the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Pelagians, Nestorians, Eutychians,</hi> with all the rable of other damned heretickes, we acknowledge it is our portion to be rayled on, with our Maſter Chriſt; and ſo ſhake of this froth of a malicious ſtomacke, with that ſpeech of the Archangell, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi>

               <p>Now for a Concluſion, that the end might be ſutable to the beginning, he laboures to diſgrace the principles of our Religion; by affirming, as truely, as he hath done all the reſt, that if our principles bee true, then <hi>Saint Paule</hi> exhorts men to infidelity. How many of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, thinke you, hee ouerthrowes by this reaſon? But poore one, if it were neuer ſo true, and being falſe, as it is, not that neither.</p>

                  <hi>But Saint Paul doth exhort vs to doubt of our ſaluation, which wee are bound to beleeue by faith, according to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe it makes for the better vnderſtanding of this Reaſon, I will in few wordes ſet downe what we teach, concerning this point. Namely, that it behooues euery Chriſtian to laboure for the perfection, as of other graces, ſo of the aſſurance, that comes by faith alſo. Which ſtandes in a full perſwaſion of the loue of God in Ieſus Chriſt, and the continuance thereof, to his euerlaſting ſaluation. In deed this is not the proper nature of faith, which rather is that grace; whereby we caſt our ſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, to be ſaued by him. But it is an effect of faith, which euery Chriſtian muſt ſtriue to haue grounded in him ſelfe: ſo that, if he haue it not, he failes in one duty to God. But we may not imagine, that whoſoeuer hath not this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling aſſurance of Gods loue to him, either is without faith, or ſhalbe damned, for the want of this perſwaſion. Nay we make no queſtion, but that both faith it ſelfe, &amp; this effect of it, is in al, or the moſt part, very far from perfection, euery one hauing his meaſure alotted vnto him, according to the good pleaſure of God; who ſees how much is neceſſary for euery one, in regard of the inward, and outward trialls, which hee ſhall haue in this life. This muſt wee indeuour by all good meanes to eſtabliſh, and augment; &amp; herevnto belongs that exhortation of the Apoſtles, <hi>With feare and trembling worke your ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two kinds of men, whom it doth concerne. <hi>Firſt</hi> thoſe, that vainely deceaue themſelues with an opinion of of faith, wheras they haue none. <hi>Let him, that thinks he ſtands take heed leaſt he fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they, that in deed do truely beleeue: who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their faith is vnperfect, muſt labour dayly for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thereof; which they ſhall neuer attaine to, if they bee careles, and do not continually ſtand in feare of falling, by reaſon of their owne infirmity.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:20998:43"/>
               <p>So that this exhortation doth not forbid ſtri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but inioyne the meanes of attaining thereto: which is, dayly to ſtand in feare of our corruption, becauſe we are not perfect in faith. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway:</hi> feare to<note place="margin">Pro. 28. 14</note> ſinne is no way againſt faith; becauſe faith hath receaued no promiſe of full freedome from ſinne. Feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> is neceſſarily annexed to the former, becauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſinne is death. Whereof we may taſte, in our owne feeling, by reaſon of our weake faith, if we doe not worke our ſaluation with feare and trembling.</p>
               <p>What his meaning ſhould be, in his laſt ſentence, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not geſſe. For, I thinke, he will not ſay, that this <hi>filiall feare</hi> comprehends in it <hi>ſeruile feare</hi> alſo; becauſe then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction will ſcarce be currant: vnleſſe he expound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as I ſayd before, that the feare of puniſhment followes vpon the feare of ſinne; in which reſpect we neede not doubt to graunt, that the Apoſtle exhorts vs to both kinds of feare: and yet ſo, as that he no way perſwades to infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, though the Proteſtants principle be, that <hi>we are bound to beleeue by faith that we ſhalbe ſaued.</hi>

               <p>The beſt is, we are not charged with denying, that a man is bound to aske God forgiuenes of ſinnes, but only, that we do it againſt that duty, to which in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience we are bound. Therefore, if this cauil were a true challenge, we might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily be thought abſurd, in holding opinions, that cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree togeather, but we could not be counted impious; ſince we vrge, and practize continually, and daily praier, for the obtayning of forgiuenes; but this conceit is fancied by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, not ſo much as fauored by our doctrine.

               <p>Perhaps ſome man will maruell, that this Papiſt, as it may<note place="margin">A.</note> ſeeme vnneceſſarily, makes ſo often mention of <hi>beleeuing by faith,</hi> and being <hi>aſſured by faith;</hi> becauſe there can be no aſſurance, or beleefe but only by faith. But he doth it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to their Popiſh doctrine: which acknowledgeth a kinde of aſſurance, but that, not of faith, but of hope. There is (ſay they,) concerning euery mans owne ſaluation, <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo ſpei, Aſſurance of hope,</hi> but not <hi>Certitudo fidei, Aſſurance of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of this diſtinction is, that hope may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, but faith cannot. Which they would neuer ſay, if they conſidered, that all true Chriſtian hope ariſeth from ſome promiſe made vnto vs by God in the Scriptures, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we haue intereſt by nothing, but <hi>faith.</hi> What a vaine thing is it, for a man to hope for ought, at Gods hands, as the world commonly doth, without any likelyhood of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining it? and what likelyhood can there be, where there is a flat proteſtation to the contrary? namely, that nothing is to be looked for at the hands of God, either by <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> but in, and for Ieſus Chriſt. All the bleſſings, that <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, could make any claime to, were to be held by guift vpon promiſe. Therefore if we wilbe his children, as we muſt be, if we be faithfull, we haue nothing to truſt to, but Gods promiſe in Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Faith</hi> then is the ground of <hi>Hope,</hi> and according to the meaſure of true beleeuing, ſo is the meaſure of all true hoping. Let vs exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie it a little.</p>
               <p>Do I hope for euerlaſting life? What reaſon haue I to hope for it? the promiſe of God, that proclaimeth pardon of ſinne, and inheritance of Glory to all, that beleeue in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. But how doth that concerne me? by reaſon of my faith in Chriſt. So that, if I beleeue not in Chriſt, I doe but deceiue my ſelfe, with a ſhadowe of hope; for true Chriſtian hope I haue none.</p>
               <p>But I hope I beleeue in Chriſt. But that will not ſerue thy turne. For ſo dooth euery man, that hath heard
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20998:91"/> of Chriſt, and beleeueth the truth of the Goſpell: and yet he is farre from true hope, and from that, which the Papiſts themſelues require of euery Chriſtian. Who teach that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, by receauing the Sacrament of Baptiſme, is actually purged from all his ſinnes before committed: which he muſt certainely be perſwaded, and aſſured of. The like they ſay of their ſacraments of penance, and of extreame vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Which he, that receaueth dying, hauing a generall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke faith, ſhall ſurely go to heauen, though perhaps through Purgatory. In ſomuch that if he, which is thus prepared, ſhould doubt whether he were ſaued, or no, he ſhould ſinne mortally. Therefore to conclude this point, which I haue hit vpon, this by the waie I ſay it is plaine, that faith limits hope, and that there is no true hope, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hoping, but proportionably to the meaſure of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Which will eaſilier be acknowledged of vs, if we remember, that hope in the Scriptures is applied to thoſe things, which we muſt of neceſſitie beleeue by faith. And in deed the true difference betwixt faith, and hope, is not in the diuerſitie of aſſurance, but in the circumſtance of time. Faith reaching to all times paſt, preſent, and to come: hope being reſtrained onely to the future time. A Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man beleeueth by faith, that God will bleſſe him in all things of this life, ſo farre forth, as it ſhall make for his owne glory, and the beleeuers ſaluation. Therefore alſo he hopeth for this bleſſing from God, not abſolutely, but with thoſe conditions, which faith obſerues in beleeuing. The ſame man beleeues by faith, that becauſe he truſts in Chriſt, he is now in the fauour of God, and ſhall ſo continue for euer. Therefore accordingly he hopes for ſaluation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other condition. Of the truth of theſe things I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not, but only bring them to ſhew the nature of hope; which is alwayes fitted according to the nature of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which faith reſts vpon: Where we beleeue conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, we hope conditionally: where our faith is abſolute, our hope is ſo too.</p>

               <p>That the propoſition is falſe it appeares by the example<note place="margin">B. To the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Who praies to God for the pardon of thoſe ſinnes, which he beleeued by faith were forgiuen (for ſo was he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, from the Lord, by the prophet <hi>Nathan</hi>) vnleſſe we ſhall charge him with infidelity, for not beleeuing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: ſince the ſpeech was ſo plaine, that hee could not but vnderſtand it. <hi>I haue ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> A plaine, and<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 13.</note> true Confeſſion <hi>The Lord alſo hath put away thy ſinne; thou ſhalt not dye.</hi> As plaine, and certaine an abſolution. Will you come in here with your vaine diſtinctions of guilt, and puniſhment, of temporall, and eternall? If you do, it is to no purpoſe. For, whatſoeuer the reſpects were, in which <hi>Dauid</hi> praied for the forgiuenes of ſinnes, once this is cleere, that he praied for it: and then what remaines, but that you condemne him of ſinning greeuouſly, in asking God pardon for thoſe ſinnes, which he beleeued by faith were forgiuen; or of infidelitie for not beleeuing? But if <hi>Dauid,</hi> in ſome regard, might craue pardon, when it was already graunted, and beleeued by him to be ſo; be thinke your ſelfe what will become of your propoſition, and how wiſely you haue charged vs with ſinning greeuouſly, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which in ſome reſpect, may be lawfully done.</p>
               <p>Now for your diſtinctions, I will not waſt time, nor blot paper to refute them: but onely ſhew, that in this caſe, they cannot helpe you. Which of the former is apparant: becauſe the Prophet preciſely mentions both parts. <hi>The Lord hath taken awaie thy ſinne:</hi> There is the guilt wipt away. <hi>Thou ſhalt not die:</hi> There is the puniſhment forgiuen. Yea, you will ſay, the eternall puniſhment, but not the temporall. I pray you whether of the two is it, that God threatens <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> withall? <hi>The day thou eateſt thou ſhalt die the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The puniſhment; yea the whole penaltie of the ſtatute concerning ſinne is, <hi>Thou ſhalt die.</hi> See how God, for the comfort of <hi>Dauid,</hi> proclaimes this pardon, in the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not die.</hi> Who ſhall perſwade vs now, that the pardon is leſſe generall, then the penalty.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:20998:92"/>
               <p>But is the eternall puniſhment indeed forgiuen? I thinke you miſtake your ſelfe, or els popiſh doctrine hanges but ill fauoredly togeather. For what is that, which you ſay is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from eternall, to temporall? Is it not the puniſhment due to ſinne? how is it then forgiuen, vnles forgiuenes of ſinnes be nothing els, but a changing of the puniſhment: which if we grant, then Chriſt hath not obteyned any more for vs, but the altering of the puniſhment; then God hath not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned our ſin, but remitted ſomwhat of the penalty. Speake not here of the effect of baptiſme; for, if by forgiueneſſe of ſinnes therein, we are wholy acquitted from the guilt, and puniſhment, why ſhould the ſame words after baptiſme, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a change of the puniſhment, and not a full pardon? <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore, in praying for pardon of thoſe ſinnes, which he beleeued by faith were already pardoned, by his practiſe deſtroyed this popiſh reaſon, long before it was hatcht. Nor may you anſwere, that this prayer was for any temporall Calamity, which was layde vpon him, for this ſinne, becauſe the ſcriptures make theſe requeſts diuers. Hee was threatned by the prophet, that the child borne in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 18. Pſa. 32. 3. 4 &amp; 51. 1. 2.</note> ſhould ſurely dye. For the life of the childe he prayes, faſtes, and weepes, but thoſe 2. Pſalmes, I ſpake of, are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature; not once mentioning, nor once glancing at any temporall, or outward affliction. And if there be in deede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch dictinction of guilt, and puniſhment, <hi>Dauid</hi> intreats directly and principally for the former: <hi>According to the multitude of thy mercies waſh me throughly</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20998:92"/> noe ſatisfaction, but a contrite ſpirit, and a broken heart: which is no more; then the firſt entrance into popiſh abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, neither, by praying for the ioy of the ſpirit, doth hee beg any exemption from purgatory: becauſe a man may haue that, after diuers ſinnes committed, in ſome good meaſure, and yet be lyable to the fire of purgatory: by omitting ſome duties, which he is enioyned by his ghoſtly father to performe.

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon it neceſſarily enſues, that the propoſition is vntrue, which condemns euery one of ſinning grieuouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, that askes forgiuenes of his ſins, being aſſured by faith, that they are forgiuen, But for the better cleering of this point, let vs alſo ſhape a direct anſwer to his proofes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſet downe, what we maintaine, concerning praying for pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſinnes. His firſt proofe is taken from an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of parity, or equality in this ſort, or forme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If none, but an Infidell, or a mad ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would demaund of God the creation of the world, the incarnation of Christ, the institution of the Sacraments, all which he is aſſured by faith are performed already, then none, but ſuch an one, will demaund pardon of his ſynnes, which he beleeues already by faith, God hath forgiuen.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:20998:93"/>
               <p>The conſequence of this propoſition is feeble, becauſe it preſumes an equalitie, where there is none. For we haue not the like meaſure of aſſurance, for the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, as we haue of theſe other points here ſignified: as I haue ſhewed already, and muſt ſay againe by and by, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the aſſumption. Therefore though we ſhould ſinne greeuouſly in crauing thoſe things of God, which without all doubt we are aſſured he hath already done, becauſe we ſhould but mocke him: yet do we not ſinne, in like ſort by deſiring that, wherof our weake faith muſt needs make ſome queſtion. I graunt we ſinne by doubting, through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our faith; but I deny we ſinne by praying, becauſe of that doubting. Further, we are to conſider, that there is a great difference betwixt theſe things, euen in reſpect of their being paſt: for the three former are abſolutely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht, the later, after a ſort, is euery day a doing: becauſe howſoeuer, in the euerlaſting purpoſe of God, the ſinnes of all the elect are already, from all eternitie, forgiuen; yet they are, in reſpect of vs, and the actuall being of them, day by day actually remitted: and therefore we may, without grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne, and muſt (vnleſſe we will ſinne greeuouſly) daily craue pardon of God; becauſe we haue new ſinnes dayly to be forgiuen. The point will be made more plaine, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But none, but a mad man, or Infidell, will demaund of God the creation of the world, the incarnation of Chriſt, the inſtitution of the Sacraments, all which he is aſſured by faith, are already giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a man be fully aſſured, that theſe things are already accompliſht, he cannot without ſinne, demaund of God the accompliſhing of them: but, if there ariſe in his minde ſome doubt concerning the certainety thereof, he may, and muſt entreate the Lord to reueale the truth vnto him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vnto him the aſſurance of it: though his doubting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſinne, yet haue we no iuſt cauſe, nor ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to condemne this doubting faith of flatte infidelitie, as this rigorous Papiſt doth; who neuer felt, it ſhould ſeeme,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20998:93"/> what conflicts there are betwixt faith and frailty.</p>
               <p>Now the Propoſition, and aſſumption being both faulty, how can the concluſion be without fault? Therefore, this former proofe not being able to abide the proofe; let vs trie the latter, which muſt thus be applyed to the Authors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the proofe of the firſt propoſition.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The former anſwer, of the meaſure of the aſſurance, argues this aſſumption of falſhood: becauſe a man may by faith truly beleeue, that his ſinnes are forgiuen, and yet not fully, or certainly be reſolued thereof, in regarde whereof he may, and ought to ſue for pardon.</p>

And this is an effect of that iuſtifying faith, by which we lay hold on, and apply vnto our ſelues the ſufferings of Chriſt; which euery true Chriſtian man feeles in himſelfe, in part, whiles he liues in this vale of miſery, and wholly, at the time of his departure henco; the ſpirit taking from him all conſcience of ſinne, and filling his ſoule with the vndoubted feeling of that ioy, which God hath prepared for him in Ieſus Chriſt. Other aſſurance then this, or in other maner, we teach not, and namely not this; that he is not to be eſteemed, as a true Chriſtian, who makes any doubt, vpon any occaſion of the pardon of any ſinne.</p>
               <p>Now, for a concluſion of this Article, he geathers of the<note place="margin">F.</note> former point, that no Proteſtant can, with a ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſay <hi>the Lords Prayer:</hi> becauſe therein he muſt aske forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, whereas he beleeues already, that all are forgiuen.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The reaſon ſtands thus.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>He, that cannot, without note of infidelitie, aske forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, cannot, with a ſafe conſcience, ſay the Lords Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What this <hi>note of Infidelitie</hi> meanes, we ſhall more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie examine, in the aſſumption. If by <hi>a ſafe conſcience,</hi> hee meane a conſcience free from ſinne, euen in the very action of prayer; we graunt his concluſion. Becauſe (as it ſhall appeare, in the next article) no man performes any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in this life, vnto God, but it is ſtained with ſome ſpot
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20998:48"/> of his naturall corruption. But, if by <hi>a ſafe conſcience,</hi> he vnderſtand a conſcience without ſinne, in reſpect of his praying (as I am perſwaded he doth) I deny the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his propoſition. For though a man cannot craue pardon of ſinne, with a full aſſurance, the want whereof this Papiſt ſeemes to call a note of infidelitie, yet he may make that petition, <hi>with a ſafe conſcience;</hi> that is, without any iuſt checke of conſcience, for praying ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But no Proteſtant can, without note of infidelitie, aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That weake faith is not to be counted infidelitie, I take it, no Chriſtian doubts at all. And as little, that it is not a note of infidelitie, to begge pardon of our ſinnes. The aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof though we ſhould haue; yet we haue it, but in part. Therefore this aſſumption is voide of truth, as the whole diſcourſe of this article hath proued. For I make no doubt, but that by note of Infidelitie, he meanes (as before) want of faith, in not beleeuing, that our ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: or in demaunding that of God, which by faith we are aſſured, he hath already performed. All which being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before, there remaines nothing, but that I ſhortly declare what we hould and teach, concerning praying for forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. Firſt, we beleeue and teach, that all our ſynnes originall, and actuall; before, and after Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; both guilt, and puniſhment, temporall, and eternall, are waſht away by the bloud and ſufferings of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Secondly, that this pardon is made effectuall to vs, <hi>by faith,</hi> whereby we caſt our ſelues vpon Chriſt, to be ſaued by him. Thirdly, that the aſſurance, which followes vpon beleeuing, is wrought in euery man, according to his meaſure, and is in no man, ordinarily, ſo perfect, but that it is mixed with ſome doubting, more or leſſe. How praying for pardon of ſinnes may ſtand with this faith, though I haue ſhewed ſufficiently already: yet it will not be amiſſe to declare it more fully, for anſwer to this accuſation.</p>
               <p>We beleeue, in ſome meaſure that God hath forgiuen all our
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20998:95"/> ſinnes, in our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt. But, becauſe our faith is weake, we continually pray to God for pardon: or rather for the aſſurance of our pardon to be encreaſed neither yet doth it follow, that then prayer for forgiueneſſe is an effect of a weake faith; becauſe though our faith were ſtrong? yet the feeling of our owne wretchedneſſe, the iuſt deſert of ſin, and the wrath of God due vnto vs, would wring out ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie from vs: as we ſee the extremity which our ſauiour Chriſt was in vpon the Croſſe made him cry out ſo maynly, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> albeit he was fully aſſured, that God neither had, nor would vtterly forſake him.</p>
               <p>Ad hereunto, that we do indeed properly demaund for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinne; becauſe we are to receaue actual pardon from God continually, both for our originall corruption, which alwaies, in this life, abides with vs, and for actuall ſins, which we dayly, and hourely commit againſt the maieſtie of Almighty God. If any man ſhall inferre hereupon, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the perſon ſueing is guilty of damnation till his ſinne be forgiuen, which muſt enſue vpon his prayer. I anſwer, that in reſpect of God, it is pardoned, as ſoone, as committed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he, that once beleeueth is thereby made a member of Chriſts myſtical body, and ſo hath all his ſinnes ſatisfied for, by the death, and ſuffrings of his head Chriſt: But to him, that is, in his feeling, it is not by and by forgiuen; namely til by repentance he haue craued mercy of God for it.</p>
               <p>But indeed the chiefe reaſon, and end of our praying to God for pardon, is, that we may alwayes acknowledge, that euery ſinne committed by vs, deſerues euerlaſting damnaton, of it ſelfe, and ſhould euerlaſtingly be puniſht, if that God had not accepted our ſauiour Chriſts ſatisfaction for vs; By which though wee are freed, if we reſt on him by faith; yet both it is our duty, according to Gods commaundement, to ſue for pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his ſake, &amp; in truth, if we doe it not, we haue no reaſon to perſwade our ſelues, that our ſinnes are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For howſoeuer it is true, that Chriſt our head, hath paid the price, of our ranſome: yet it is alſo true, that we euery day
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20998:95"/> deſerue condemnation, &amp; muſt entreate God for pardon, that ſo we may come to that aſſurance, which the Lord hath enioyned vs to labour and ſeeke for. The ſome of all is this, that we pray for pardon of our ſinnes, 1. becauſe Chriſt hath taught, and commaunded vs ſo to pray, 2. becauſe, by our ſinnes, we haue deſerued eternall damnation, 3. becauſe wee muſt dayly renew our repentance, as we commit new ſinnes euery day, 4. becauſe we haue not abſolute aſſurance of the forgiueneſſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps will rather anſwere, that we haue no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at all, but ſo long, as we continue members of Chriſts body; which is no longer (ſay they) then we refraine from great ſinnes; for by euery ſuch ſinne (they ſay) we are cut of from Chriſt, and therefore haue need to pray for pardon of it. But this anſwere both is falſe, in regard of that, it affirmes, concerning our being out of Chriſt; and alſo doth not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the whole doubt. For it ſhewes no reaſon why we may pray for the forgiueneſſe of any other ſinnes, then thoſe great ones. So that either we muſt not craue pardon for ſmal tranſgreſſions, or els muſt do it needleſly? ſince they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pardoned, as long as we abide in the body of our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt. Wherefore I had rather reſt vpon the former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, which is agreeable to the word of God, and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by true reaſon.</p>

Yet doth not this admixtion of our ſinnefulneſſe, change the nature of the worke, as if it made that dutie a ſinne, which is of it ſelfe obedience: but takes from the particular act, all power to iuſtifie, and deſerue at Gods hands, which otherwiſe it hath, vpon Couenant betwene God, and vs. For example, <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, geuing of Almes,</hi> and ſuch like, are not made ſinnes by any Corruption of ours: but the actions of theſe vertues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed by vs vnperfectly, and ſinfully, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes are, if they bee examined in the ſeueritie of Gods iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, wilbe condemned as ſinnefull, not rewarded as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; becauſe we haue deſiled them.

But concerning deadly ſinne, if thereby hee vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d notorious, and willfull breaking of the law of God, by ſome greiuous tranſgreſſion, we deny, that all good works are ſo much as infected with dead y ſinne. For we knowe, and profeſſe, that, in the whole courſe of our obedience to God, wee are ordinarily free from ſuch ſinnes, and that the Corruption, which defiles our works, proceeds rather from weakenes, then willfullnes.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20998:52"/> As for thoſe actions of ours, which haue ſuch groſſe ſinnes adioyned to them, wee deny that they can, any way truely challenge ſo much as the bare name of good workes, in the ſight of God. Such are thoſe vaineglorious, and hypocriticall deeds of the Phariſies: Which our Sauiour condemnes; and ſuch, to come neerer home, are popiſh good works. Becauſe they are grounded vpon an euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; namely a purpoſe, and Conceit of iuſtifying the doers thereof, &amp; deſeruing <hi>Ex rigore iuſtitia,</hi> in the rigor of iuſtice, euerlaſting glory of almighty God.</p>
               <p>This I auouch generally of all their good workes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: and particularly of all the. 3. here named, I ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that, in ſome part, for the very ſubſtance of them, they are no better, nor other then ſinnes. <hi>Faſting</hi> is not of it ſelfe any good worke; as if it made a man more acceptable to God, then moderate eating doth; but in. 2. reſpects it is vpon iuſt occaſion to bee vſed, either for teſtifying of our humiliation, by acknowledging our ſelues vnworthy ſo much, as to taſte of any of Gods creaturs: or els for the better preparing of our ſelues to call vpon God by prayer. But <hi>Popiſh faſting</hi> accounts the very abſteining from meat, a parte of holines, and not ſimply from meat, but from ſome kinds of meat. So that a man may fully, and truely keepe a popiſh faſt, though he neither be humbled in the ſenſe of his ſinne, nor conſideration of Gods wrath d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer</hi> indeed is of another nature, as being a duty by which in it ſelfe, God is properly honored, whether it be by petition, or thankſgiuing. But <hi>Popiſh prayer</hi> ſtandeth in vaine repetition of <hi>Pater-noſters, Aue-maryes, Creeds,</hi> (whereof the two laſt alſo are nothing leſſe then prayers) and that many times for a penance. And out of doubt they are not much deceaued therein; for it is a grieuous puniſhment of blindneſſe, and ſenſeleſneſſe, to imagine, that ſuch toyleſome lip-labour can pleaſe God. Yet all this might haue the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhew of prayer, if that, which is babled ouer, were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: but, for the moſt part, the common people pray, as Parrats ſpeake, altogether by rote, without knowledge what they ſay. Shall I adde herevnto, that the prayers, which ordinarily are made by poore ignorant ſoules, are not made to God but to creatures? inſomuch that it hath bene held here in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo no doubt is yet in Popiſh countries, for a certaine marke of an heretick, for a man to offer vp his owne prayers to God, in Ieſus Chriſt, without the mediation of ſome Saint or other. All which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red we truly auouch, that this <hi>Popiſh praying is ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the like we affirme of ſome <hi>almeſgiuing;</hi> howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we gladly acknowledge, that the duty of it ſelfe, is one of thoſe ſacrifices, with which God is highly pleaſed.

                  <hi>which hath not care of his owne, eſpecially of his domeſticals, is worſe then an Infidell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, if we ſpeake of theſe workes, as they are done, and allowed by the Papiſts, we ſay that they are <hi>deadly ſinnes,</hi> not only faulty, by reaſon of infirmitie; which, for the moſt part, is the eſtate of thoſe good workes, that the faithfull in weakneſſe performe. Yet are they not, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, <hi>deadly ſinnes,</hi> nor infected with deadly ſinne:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20998:53"/> but only, as all ſinnes, how light account ſoeuer the Papiſts make of them, deſerue eternall death. Neither doth it follow vpon the graunt of this infection, and deſert, that therefore they are to be avoyded, no more, then, that a ſicke man is bound to ſtarue himſelfe by faſting, as <hi>Pomponius Atticus</hi> abſurdly did, becauſe his feeding continued his diſeaſe, and that, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, <hi>the more you nouriſh ſome ſycke bodyes, the more you corrupt them.</hi> The ſinne indeed, which cleauing to the worke defiles it, is by all meanes poſſible to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but not the worke it ſelfe to be forborne. For we haue an abſolute charge from God, to exerciſe our ſelues in all good workes, and a merciful promiſe of forgiueneſſe of thoſe infirmities, which our corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to our beſt indeauors. In matters indifferent, that are put to our choiſe, to be done or left vndone, it is a good rule to refraine, becauſe our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will bring forth ſome ſinne, in the doing of them. As for example, it is lawfull for me to play at cheſſe or tenniſle, but if I find by experience, that I cannot vſe theſe exerciſes, without ſome ſpecial ſinne, as ſwearing, curſing, &amp; fretting, loſſe of too much time. &amp;c.

For his ſpeech is generall of all Chriſtians whatſoeuer, that know God to euerlaſting life; and that not of their abilitie, what they can doe, but of their practiſe, what they doe; and I hope no Papiſt thinkes, that euery true Chriſtian keepes all the commaundements wholy, and perfectly. For then what ſhall become of the Sacrament of penance, and extreame vnction? But you will ſay, they may keepe them, though they doe not; I would beleeue it, if you could ſhew me an example of any that euer did it. But theſe places, I alledged a little before, manifeſtly proue, that they, that are renowned for holineſſe, were priuie to their owne vnrighteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Nay, what Saints ſtory haue you, any thing largely ſet downe in the Scriptures, whoſe life is not tainted with ſome diſobedience? did thoſe worthies faint ſometimes, and can we ſtand without ſnaking? It is more honourable to God, and comfortable to Chriſtians, truely to acknowledge the imperfection of their owne workes, and the perfection of Gods mercy, who vouchſafes a reward to thoſe poore endeuours, which, of themſelues, by reaſon of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherewith they are defiled, deſerue, in the rigour of his iuſtice, euerlaſting condemnation.</p>

               <p>In deed a generall, or rather a particular induction of all matters, that Proteſtants call in queſtion, is of neceſſity to the proofe of this Article. But neither, if ſuch an Induction were made could any ſuch thing bee done: and that not being done, there is not ſo much as any reaſonable courſe taken for the proofe of it; for what if all theſe points here ſet down tend to looſeneſſe of life? Alas, 7. are neither all, nor the moſt part, nor any thing neere the moſt part of thoſe points wherein we diſſent from the Papiſts.

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Nay more then that, wee ſay that free will is a mere fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, a bare name, without any thing anſwerable vnto it, in the nature of man, at the leaſt, ſince his fall in Adam. But if it be his meaning to charge vs with a purpoſe to bring in looſeneſſe of life, and carnall liberty, by the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of this Doctrine, we appeale from this vniuſt ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer; Firſt to the iudgement of God, that ſearcheth the

               <p>But, to come neerer to the point, we are to vnderſtand that the Proteſtants Doctrine of free wil is, that no man hath power by nature, either (without the grace of Gods ſpirit) to do any thing acceptable vnto God, or to procure this grace to himſelfe, or to receaue it when it is offered.

                  </gap> the good vſe of his free will, that beleeues, we aſcribe it to the diuers working of Gods ſpirit in his heart; not denying that he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his free will (to ſpeake as they doe) better then the other, but acknowledging that therefore he ſo vſeth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpirit of God teacheth, and inclines, and ineuitably brings him ſo to vſe it: that the difference may be from God, and not from man.</p>

                  <hi>To what end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tends this doctrine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be poſſible that any man ſhould be ſo blinde, as not to ſee, I will venture the loſſe of ſo much time, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as may ſerue to ſhew him: You aske vs, why we ſay that men are ſaued by Gods grace &amp; not by their owne freewill. Forſooth becauſe we would haue God reape the glory of their ſaluation; the pride of mans nature beaten down, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more beholding to God then to themſelues. None of which can be, if a man, by his owne free will, make difference betwixt himſelfe; and another, to the receauing of faith.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20998:59"/> For he may truly ſay to God, that he is no more beholding to him, then many a one, that is euerlaſtingly damned; nay then euery one might haue bene, if he would. For what did God for him, that he was not as ready to doe for another? how many haue had as much grace offred them, as he, and yet are not iuſtified? No more had he bene, if he had not, by his owne free-will, helpt himſelfe in ſpeciall maner, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God failed him, leauing all to his choiſe to be ſaued, or not to be ſaued. Is this to teach carnall libertie? you will ſay, yea; becauſe it maketh a man negligent in diſpoſing and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſoule. How ſo? for the difference is made by God. What then? to what purpoſe is it, forme to prepare my ſelfe? I maruell you aske not, to what purpoſe it is for you, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. Are you yet to learne, that although the cauſe of all goodneſſe be grace; yet God requires our endeuours, as meanes, to the receauing of this grace? Did you neuer heare, that we holde it for a monſtrous abſurditie, to promiſe our ſelues any thing from God, without vſing the meanes to obtaine it? The ſame alſo I anſwere to the doing of good workes after ſanctification: the ſucceſſe, and euent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds onely, and certainly from the ſpirit of God, who<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> workes in vs both to will, and to doe. Yet are we bound to vſe all good meanes, for the ſtirring our ſelues vp to holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and freely, and willingly doe we whatſoeuer good worke, we do by the grace of Gods ſpirit. Therefore this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the ſicke Aſſe, ſheweth the Authors dangerous ſickneſſe, eyther of ignorance, if he know not the truth we holde, or of malice, if, againſt this knowledge, he wilfully peruert it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They defend</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that men are iuſtified by faith alone.</hi> That is, we defend that God requireth nothing of man to his iuſtification, but only, that by faith he reſt vpon Ieſus Chriſt, to be iuſtified by his ſuffrings.</p>
               <p>The generall ground of this opinion, is the end of all things created; <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, that man may haue nothing to boaſt of, but ſimply aſcribe the praiſe of his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20998:59"/> iuſtification to God that iuſtified him. Neither doth this doctrine (ſcorne God in reiecting it, as much as you liſt) ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flatly ouerthrow, or in any part diminiſh <hi>true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſorrowe for ſinnes, mortification of paſſions, and all other vertues,</hi> which will plainely appeare both before and after iuſtification; for what though we be iuſtified onely by faith? who knowes not, that it is vnpoſſible for any man (ordinarily) to caſt of this naturall, and Popiſh confidence, which he hath in his owne righteouſneſſe, and to feele ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of being iuſtified by Chriſt, If firſt he diſcerne not his damnable eſtate, and being moued with horror thereof, ſhe from himſelfe to Chriſt for iuſtification, by pardon of ſinne? Now after a man is iuſtified, can the knowledge of the meanes, by which he is iuſtified, kill theſe vertues in him? Let the meanes, and cauſe of his iuſtification be what you will; If he may beleeue he is iuſtified (and the Papiſts graunt ſome men haue knowne, and more may know it, at leaſt by reuelation) by your reaſon this effect muſt enſue. So that it ariſeth not from the doctrine of the meanes, but from that of knowledge or aſſurance. But how ſhould theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be aboliſht by iuſtification, by faith only? when as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man that is iuſtified, is alſo ſanctified.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer hath his ſinnes forgiuen him, hath withall the power of ſinne abated in him. <hi>How ſhall we, that are dead</hi>

                  <hi>to ſinne, liue any longer therein?</hi> No man hath any incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by free iuſtification through faith, to continue in ſinne. For, if he be not ſanctified, he is not iuſtified. If he be ſanctified, he is dead to ſinne, and aliue to righteouſneſſe. True it is that prophane wretches will obiect againſt the Goſpell now, as they did in the Apoſtles time. But this was not then, nor is now, any ſufficient reaſon, why the truth of God ſhould be denyed, or ſuppreſt, for wicked mens abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, to their owne damnation. Yet perhaps you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that it is a more likly meanes to ſtir me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to <hi>repentance, mortification, and the practiſe of all vertues,</hi> to teach them, that they muſt deſerue the firſt iuſtification of congruitie,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20998:60"/> by their good preparation, and fully make vp the meaſure of their ſecond iuſtification, by deſeruing of condignitie, for their good workes, euerlaſting life. Firſt let vs ſuppoſe it be likely in our corrupt iudgment, yet may we not gratifie God with a lye, nor doe euill that good may come of it. And why ſhould not we follow the practiſe of the Apoſtles; whoſe courſe is in all their Epiſtles, ſtill to vrge grace in iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and good workes for thankfulneſſe, not for merit? yet we deny not, but it is both warranted by the Scriptures, and moſt conuenient to adde an edge to the workes of ſanctification, by threatning condemnation to ſinners, and promiſing reward to the righteous. But we deny, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe enforcements of ſuch exhortation, in any part, weakens the doctrine of free iuſtification by onely reſting vpon Ieſus Chriſt. Which he may eaſily conceaue, that hath a ſincere purpoſe to glorifie God, by the ſaluation of his choſen. For he knowes, that as much as is giuen to man for iuſtifying himſelfe, is taken from God. God, and man, after this reckoning, may part ſtakes. God may haue glory for affording meanes of ſaluation, and abilitie to vſe thoſe meanes: man may be proud of the well vſing of that abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and iuſtifying of himſelfe by the meanes afforded. Yet, if all men, that are inabled, did ſo helpe themſelues, there were leſſe cauſe of boaſting, &amp; more reaſon to giue God the glory of iuſtification. For it might well ſeeme to proceed from the grace, that God imparts to them, that they are iuſtified. But when ſome vſe it well, ſome ill, and this difference of well, or ill vſing it, flowes from the free-will of men, by their owne power; what a ſmall part of glory is left to God, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall iuſtification of thoſe, that are ſaued? Hence it follows, that the doctrine of iuſtification by workes preparatorie, before a man is at all iuſtified, &amp; by workes meritorious, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is begun to be iuſtified, is diſhonorable to God, &amp; the death of all goodneſſe in thoſe very workes, that are done. Becauſe the intent, which our Papiſts magnifie ſo much, is directly derogatorie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glory of God, without the true,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20998:60"/> and ſincere purpoſe whereof, no workes of any man bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are one iott better, then the morall actions of heathen men. But the ſonnes of the bond-woman, being of a ſeruile nature, reſpecting themſelues either only, or principally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant, and without feeling of the affection of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can neuer be perſwaded, that any ſonne of God will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme duties of kindneſſe, and thankfulneſſe to his father: but muſt needs doe that he doth, like a hireling, for loue of wages. And by ſuch meanes our Papiſts <hi>would procure, and deſerue the perfect reconciliation of their ſoules with God;</hi> as if we were not perfectly reconciled in Chriſt, in <hi>whom God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the world to himſelfe, not imputing their ſinnes.</hi> What is it to be reconciled to God, but to haue Gods diſpleaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, &amp; his fauor, &amp; fatherly loue vouchſafed to vs? This hath Chriſt procured, by his death, and bloud-ſhedding; the increaſe of our ſanctification in vs, by the dayly dying vnto ſinne, and riſing againe vnto newneſſe of life, reſtores more perfectly the image of God decayed in vs, by naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and manifold actuall tranſgreſſions, but reconciles vs neuer awhit the more to God. When the Prodigall ſonne<note place="margin">Luc. 15. 20</note> came home to his father, ſtarued, and euill coloured in his body, ragged, and torne in his apparrell, who can doubt, for all this, but he was fully reconciled to his father, when he fell on his neck, kiſſed, embraced, and entertained him: but as his fleſh euery day came better and better, as his colour men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and waxed more freſh, when he was arrayed, according to his eſtate, he did more liuely repreſent the ſonne of ſuch a father. The ſame is our caſe in Chriſt: by his ſuffrings are we wholy reconciled vnto God. For we are made his Children; but we begin dayly, more and more to reſemble him, as we<note place="margin">Ioa. 1. 12. Gal. 4. 4. 5.</note> growe in holineſſe of nature, and conuerſation. Therefore let the Papiſts imagine that they reconcile themſelues to God by <hi>mortification of paſſions,</hi> and I know not what ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vertues: It is ſufficient for vs, that Chriſt hath, by his bloud, made our peace, and put vs in poſſeſſion of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loue and fauour.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20998:61"/> If this be a falſe fantaſticall apprehenſion of Chriſts death, and paſſion, to relie wholy vpon him for reconcilation with God, by his bloud, and propitiation; then his dying, the Apoſtles preaching, and our beleeuing is all in vaine. How then doth this Doctrine tend to looſeneſſe? eſpecially, if it be remembred, that we ſhut al men out from iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are not ſanctified by the ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>But ſome will ſay, God moued them for a good end, <hi>vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet,</hi> the redemption of man, and they intended an ill end, to wit, lucre, reuenge, or ſome other ſiniſter effect.

               <p>Agane, it cannot be ſaid, but that God indirectly and moſt effectually, intended their ſinnes.

               </p>
               <p>The Minor is to to euident: for the Proteſtants deride Gods permiſſion; they ſay, that all his actions are energetical, or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, they deſperatly auerre, that <hi>Pauls</hi> conuerſion, &amp; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> adultry, were in like maner the works of God; and as he elected ſome to Glory, before the preuiſion of workes, ſo he reiected ſome from glory, before the preuiſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Here hence I inferre, that, according to the Proteſtants principles, God is moſt properly the author of ſinne; becauſe he impelleth moſt effectually thereunto.</p>
               <p>Next, that he is the only author of ſinne, for that he inforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">D.</note> men, vpon neceſſity to ſinne, and they, as inſtruments, follow the motion of their firſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, that man ſinneth not. For where there is neceſſitie of ſinning, there is no ſinne. For ſinne is free, or no ſinne Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides how can man ſinne, in conforming his will, to Gods will?</p>
               <p>Finally God is worſe then the diuell. For that the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the diuell principally conſiſteth, in the mouing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading and inducing of men to ſin, the which, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants confeſſion, God performeth more effectually, then the Diuell; becauſe the motions of God are more forcible, &amp; leſſe reſiſtable, then the illuſions, or ſuggeſtions of the diuell.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20998:65"/> Many ſinnes moreouer are acted, without the temptations of the diuell; ſome of ignorance, ſome of paſsion; but none without the motions of God; ſo that God is worſe then the Diuell: both in cauſing greater multitude of ſinnes, then the diuell, and in the forcible maner of cauſing ſinnes. Which the diuell cannot attaine vnto. The which doctrine, is as good a ground for Atheiſme, as euer hell could deuiſe: for were it not much more reaſonable, to ſaye, there were no God at all, then to beleeue there were ſuch a God, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, perſwadeth, vrgeth, impelleth men to ſinne: and yet, for the ſame ſinnes, will torment them with the inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable paines of hell?</p>

               <p>In Gods Commaunding it is otherwiſe.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>undement. Both without ſinne: becauſe the will of God is the rule of righteouſnes, and he, that gaue man a lawe, hath reſerued authoritie to himſelfe, to diſpence with that lawe, when, and as it pleaſeth him. and as this Papiſt ſaith truely; <hi>Euery man is bound in Conſcience to Conforme his will, to the will of God.</hi> But yet this is not ſimply true. For admit that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> had knowne, that it was Gods will, that our Sauiour ſhould be betraied to the Iewes by him; might he therefore the doing of it? At no hand for he was to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20998:66"/> haue receaued a warrant for it, that it might be lawful, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had the contrary charge in the 6. Commaundement <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> But, if God had geuen him commiſſion to do it, as he did to <hi>abraham,</hi> for the offring of his ſonne, then he had bin bound to yeeld obedience to this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and had not ſinned in obeying. So much doth it concerne a man, to liue in obedience to thoſe lawes, which God hath preſcribed to all, and euery man generally, and particularly. <hi>Abraham</hi> hath a commaundement not to kill; if it be Gods wil he ſhould kill without ſinning therby, God wil giue him warrant, and charge to kil: without which (howſoeuer Gods wil ſtand) <hi>Abraham</hi> cannot do it lawfully. And therefore it had not ben warrantable for <hi>Iudas, Pilate,</hi> or the <hi>Iewes,</hi> intending that good end, which God intended, to haue done contrary to the generall commaundement of God without a ſpeciall commiſſion to that purpoſe: which is more then a knowledge, that God would haue it done. This being vnderſtood, we diſclayme, as needeleſſe, all ſuch excuſes for God, as this Papiſt ſeemeth to make, on our behalfe.</p>
               <p>For we ſay not, that God moued them, for a good end, but that he did not moue them at all, and yet there is a great deale of difference betwixt mouing, and <hi>commaunding, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading, vrging, impelling,</hi> ſince he may truly be ſaid to moue a man that offers him the outward occaſions, whereby he may be prouoked to the doing of any thing; which (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) God doth, and you will graunt may do, without being guilty of ſinne, for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>But, if we would maintaine, that God moued them, it it were no hard matter to anſwer your ſtrong proofe. For neither doth God binde him ſelfe to thoſe lawes, which he giues to man; and, his will being the rule of Iuſtice, that which he will haue done, by his willing of it, ceaſſes to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. So that, he cannot doe any euill, though he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that to be done, which till he commaunded it, could not be done without ſinne. But you vrge vs further, that

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20998:67"/> The firſt whereof is, that <hi>the Proteſtants deride Gods permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and therefore ſay, that <hi>he commaundeth, vrgeth, perſwadeth,</hi> &amp;c. Nay the Proteſtants deride only heatheniſh fancies of permiſſion, which with <hi>Epicurus</hi> make God ſit by, &amp; looke on, in worldly matters, as it were ſetting all at ſix, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for the preſent being of things. Contrary to which wee teach, that nothing falls out, one way, or other, in this world, but according to the councell, and determination of Gods euerlaſting prouidence. To make the matter more plaine. God, when he would puniſh <hi>Pharoes</hi> pride, did not careleſly leaue him to himſelfe, permitting him to ſinne or not to ſinne; but had before reſolued, that he ſhould increaſe his ſinne, to the glory of God, and his owne iuſt damnation. How then you will ſay, <hi>Did God commaund or perſwade, or vrge, or impell him to ſinne?</hi> Nothing leſſe. For indeed there neuer was, nor neuer is neede of any ſuch worke of God, for the puniſhing of ſinne by ſinne. Becauſe the ſtate of men vnregenerate is ſuch, that the diuill, by their owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can eaſily bring them to the committing of ſinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Enforcement, or perſwaſion, or commaundement of God.</hi> Yet dare not we vndertake curiouſly to inquire, and boldly to determine, by what meanes this wil of God is performed, but we content our ſelues with that, which is euident, that it is Gods will, that ſuch ſinnes ſhould be committed. Neither do we hereunto apply any effectuall, or energeticall action of God, to the enforcing of this ſinne, but onely affirme that this will of God, muſt needs take effect; and yet without any worke of God vpon the ſoules of the wicked, to <hi>commaund, perſwade, vrge, or impell them to ſinne.</hi>

               <p>And therefore the poynt, that followeth, is not deſperatly auerred by vs, but Diuilliſhly, that is ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derouſly deuiſed by you. For we conſtantly affirme, that God workes by, and in, the godly: but by the wicked only, not in them. <hi>Paules</hi> conuerſion was wholly the worke of God who enclined &amp; bowed his will, to the obeying of the truth, which of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hee did willingly, and cruelly perſecute: But <hi>Dauides</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:20998:67"/> Adultery, occaſioned by the ſight of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> proceeded from his owne concupiſcence, without any inclining of his heart thereto, on Gods part. Yet we deny not, but both the one &amp; the other, was willed of God, &amp; could not but take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, though in diuers ſorts, &amp; by diuers meanes. God would that <hi>Paule</hi> ſhould be conuerted, and this he did like of as a good, and holy thing, nay not ſo onely, but by his almighty power he wrought it, and (without forcing of <hi>Paules</hi> will) made him of vnwilling willing; it was alſo the will of God that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhould commit that Adultery, but God neither approued this fact of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as good, not ſtirred vp the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his heart, nor wrought his heart to the liking of it but only gaue him vp, for a time, to the diuill &amp; his owne corruption. Cal it permiſſion if you wil, we miſlike not you ſhould do ſo, ſo that withall you graunt, that the end of this permiſſion was, that the thing might come to paſſe, as it did.</p>
               <p>The laſt point is added ignorantly, becauſe it is the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine of the Papiſts, aſwel as of the Proteſtants, that there can be no reaſon giuen, why God chooſeth one, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth another, but his owne will.</p>

               <p>You muſt bring better proofe of your Antecedent, ere your conſequents wil be granted. For all Proteſtants deny, that God impells, eyther effectually, or at all to ſinne.

               </p>
               <p>The Maior is a principle vndoubted of, in the Schooles of Proteſtants. For they peremptorily affirme, that true faith, ſuch as was in <hi>Dauid</hi> one of Gods elected, can no more be ſeuered from charitie, then heate from fire, or light from the Sunne; and therefore if <hi>Dauid,</hi> killing <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias,</hi> loſt his charitie, no doubt but therewithall he loſt his faith.</p>
               <p>The Minor I proue: for whoſoeuer remaineth in death,<note place="margin">B.</note> is without charitie. But <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he killed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in death. <hi>Ergo, Dauid,</hi> when he killed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias,</hi> was without charitie. If he was without that, which once he had, no doubt but then he loſt it: for he was depriued thereof, for his ſinne.</p>

               <p>The Maior Propoſition of this laſt Syllogiſme, thus I prooue. For charity is the life of the ſoule, and it is as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for a man to haue charity, and remaine in death, as it is impoſſible, for a man to be dead in body, and yet indewed with a reaſonable ſoule.</p>
               <p>The Minor cannot be denied; to wit, that <hi>Dauid,</hi> by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Vrias,</hi> remained in death. For it is the expreſſe word of God. <hi>Qui non diligit, manet in morte.</hi> He that lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Any man may ſee with halfe an eye, that the point in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not concluded in this ſyllogiſme. But this fault is ſo common with this diſputer, that I am weary of noting it. The reaſon ſtands thus, being orderly, &amp; ſhortly concluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the kingdom of heauen be giuen for workes, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants will haue no merits, the Proteſtants ſhall neuer haue the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the kingdome of heauen is giuen for workes, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants will haue no merits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therfore <hi>the Proteſtants ſhall neuer haue the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See this popiſh ſleight of confounding workes, &amp; merits, as if they were all one. Indeed the ancient Latin writers put <hi>meritum,</hi> deſert or merit, for <hi>opus</hi> worke ſomtimes, &amp; <hi>mereri, to deſerue,</hi> ſometimes for <hi>conſequi, to obtaine,</hi> or to be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaft a thing. But neither are they all one in truth: and the ſcripture, that ſpeakes much of workes, neuer vtters any word of merit. Therefore the conſequence of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is little worth. Neither is the aſſumption of this ſyllogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me any better, as being altogeather falſe. For how can the kingdome of heauen be giuen for works, when as it is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> &amp; not a <hi>purchaſe.</hi> For as many as are redeemed by<note place="margin">Gal 4. 4 5. Ioa. 1. 12. Rom. 8. 17.</note> Chriſt, receaue the adoption of ſinnes, and all Gods ſonnes are heires, euen fellow heires with Ieſus Chriſt. Now to the heire, the inheritance is due, as deſcending vpon him, neither can he make purchaſe of that, which already is his owne by law. Hireling indeed worke for wages, &amp; yet many of them c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20998:71"/> this aſſumption is vnderpropt with this reaſon.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whatſoeuer is giuen as wages, is giuen for workes.</l>
                  <l>But the kingdome of heauen is giuen as wages.</l>

                     <hi>Ergo;</hi> The kingdome of heauen is giuen for workes.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This is your proofe, to the which at the laſt we are come. But you forget your ſelfe much therein. For the queſtion is not of <hi>workes,</hi> but of <hi>deſert by working;</hi> ſo that if the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this ſyllogiſme be granted, <hi>the kingdome of heauen is giuen for workes;</hi> yet are you farre enough from prouing your article, that <hi>euerlaſting life is giuen for merits.</hi> Since ſome thing may be due vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> promiſe by couenant, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is no way deſerued. And this, it ſhould ſeeme you ſaw well enough, and therefore choſe rather to bring a weake ſimilitude, then to make offer of any ſound proofe. You tell vs a tale, what the Lord may doe, vtterly to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Wherein I note onely theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that if all you aske be graunted, it helpes you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for what if <hi>euerlaſting life be giuen for workes?</hi> how often muſt you be told, that <hi>working</hi> and <hi>deſeruing</hi> are not all one? We deny not, that God will reward euery leaſt good worke of any of his children; but we cannot graunt, that eyther the reward he will giue, is euerlaſting life, or that any workes of his children deſerue that reward, which he will giue. I doubt not (which is the ſecond thing I note in his ſimilitude) but you Papiſts your ſelues would thinke it extreame preſumption, for any ſubiect to claime, as of merit, that 1000. pound a yeare, <hi>which was promiſed by the Prince, for good ſeruice in Ireland:</hi> eſpecially if it may be truely obiected againſt ſuch claime, that though ſome fewe actions haue bene valiantly performed in part; yet both in the beſt there hath beene defect, and for one thing well done, twentie haue beene left vndone. How then ſhall any man proudly vaunt of merit, that knowes what Gods law requires, and what his owne deſerts are? It is the infinite goodneſſe of God our father in Ieſus Chriſt, that he doth accept of our vnperfect obedience, &amp; crowne
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20998:72"/> it with glory, for all the imperfections thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But euerlaſting life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is called wages, and giuen as wages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if we denied, that good workes ſhall receaue reward, and need euery foote put you in minde of the difference of <hi>workes,</hi> and <hi>merites.</hi> But indeed euerlaſting life, or the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is neuer, I thinke, called <hi>wages</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There is a reward promiſed by God, <hi>viz.</hi> an increaſe of glory, which ſhalbe imparted to the faithfull, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the meaſure of grace, and vſe thereof in this life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to workes. But the kingdome of heauen is an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, belonging to all the faithfull, as members of Ieſus Chriſt their head, whoſe firſt, and properly it is. This I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a little before, and therefore will now onely ſet it out more plainely by a ſimilitude, or likeneſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſonne and heire of a King hath intereſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by right of inheritance, the Kings mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The King to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his ſonne to valure, and loue of vertue, promiſeth him that he will giue him ſome ſpeciall reward, for euery valiant exploit, or attempt, with true martiall diſcretion, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. This reward is to be raiſed out of his moueables, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen indeed for workes, but not to be claimed vpon deſert, in regard of ſome iuſt exception, which the King his father may take againſt all ſuch his enterpriſes, and atchiuements. Such is our eſtate, in matters of euerlaſting life, by reſting vpon Ieſus Chriſt to be ſaued by him, we become members of his myſticall body, ſonnes of God his father, and ours by him, heires of euerlaſting life, which is his inheritance, and ours as members of him. God our Father hath made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to vs being now ſonnes, and heires, and hauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intereſt in his kingdome, of reward of all things, that we ſhall valourouſly atchieue, or reſolutely vndertake, for the glorifying of his name, according to his will. This promiſe conueyes not to vs any title to the kingdome (for that is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20998:72"/> ours already, euen in poſſeſſion by Chriſt) but incourageth<note place="margin">1.

And yet this is not our onely, or greateſt motiue to good workes: For that ariſeth from our Child-like affection to ſo kind, and bountifull a father. Which if the Papiſts haue not, let them not therfore deny, that there is any ſuch thing: like the mole, that will not beleeue, that any beaſt can ſee, becauſe ſhe her ſelfe is blind. What if they, like hirelings, will doe nothing but for wages? The ſonnes of God in this life, take as great pleaſure in their preſent obedience, as in their future reward: which notwithſtanding they moſt aſſuredly looke for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, that can not faile, euer God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; To whome with the ſonne, and Holy Ghoſt bee all obedience, thanks, and glory, from this time for euer, and euer Amen.</p>
